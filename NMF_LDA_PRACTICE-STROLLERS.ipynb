      "[\"A popular parkside promenade running along the East River for more than a mile on Manhattan's Lower East Side has been closed indefinitely for structural repairs, depriving Fourth of July celebrants of a waterfront site for watching fireworks this week, as well as joggers, bikers and strollers who use it daily.\\nThe commissioner of parks and recreation, Henry J. Stern, said yesterday that the East River Park promenade, which skirts the river from East 14th to Montgomery Streets, was shut down last week after an inspection found severe deterioration in most of the wooden pilings that support the esplanade.\\n''Two divers were making a study of the Manhattan foot of the Williamsburg Bridge and the seawall that runs down from 14th Street,'' Mr. Stern said. ''It is not a dry seawall. The promenade and some of the park is built on pilings. Basically, the divers reported that up to 80 percent of the pilings under the promenade were deteriorated.''\\nThe commissioner said repairs to the pilings might take two or three years, and that the 30-foot-wide promenade used by hundreds of joggers and strollers regularly would remain closed for the duration. But the closing will not affect use of East River Park, a 57-acre swath of softball and baseball fields, tennis, basketball and handball courts, picnic areas and other amenities.\\nThere was no immediate estimate of the cost of the repairs. Mr. Stern said city engineers had long recognized that the promenade seawall was deteriorating and would have to be replaced at an estimated cost of $10 million. He said that $865,000 had already been budgeted to plan for the new seawall.\\nEast River Park and its promenade date from the 1930's, when they were built in the era of Robert Moses, a city official known as a prolific builder of highways, parks and other public projects. The park, the largest in Lower Manhattan, is the front yard of a series of city housing projects -- Jacob Riis, Lillian Wald and Baruch -- and is used by thousands of Lower East Side residents.\\nMr. Stern said a temporary fence would be erected between the promenade and the park at a cost of $60,000. Yesterday, only yellow police tape cordoned off the promenade. The police plan to put sawhorses and assign officers along the edge of the park Wednesday night, when thousands of spectators are expected to gather there to watch the Macy's Fourth of July fireworks display.\\nThe fireworks will be set off from four barges in the East River between East 23rd and East 42nd Streets. The best viewing will be along Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive from 14th to 42nd Streets, as well as from areas of Brooklyn and Queens with an open view.\\nAlthough the promenade had not previously been closed, Mr. Stern said there had been problems with weakened portions of its railing over the river and that restrictions last year had been imposed to keep fireworks spectators from the edge.\\n\", \"South Williamsburg and Wall Street have two of the highest concentrations of renters under 25 in New York City, according to the 2000 census. But youth is about all they have in common.\\nThe city's 1995 revitalization plan for lower Manhattan precipitated a wave of residential conversions in the financial district. From 1995 to 2000, 1,577 residential units were created between Fulton and Liberty Streets east of Broadway, according to the Alliance for Downtown New York, a business group. Last year, 22 percent of those units were rented by people under 25.\\nJonathan Falcone, 23, moved to the area last year, after graduating from the University of Pennsylvania. Next month, he and three friends will move into a $6,000-a-month three-bedroom penthouse on John Street.\\nBrian G. Edwards, leasing director at the Halstead Property Company, said people in their 20's had led the migration into the neighborhood because most of the units are studios and one-bedrooms, landlords accept shares, and the area lacks amenities that attract families.\\nBy contrast, Hasidic Williamsburg is a bright, noisy tangle of children, strollers and trees. Rabbi David Niederman, executive director of the United Jewish Organizations, said most of the century-old brownstones in the neighborhood's heart had been carved into small apartments that rent for $700 to $1,000 a month.\\nIn the past decade new construction has allowed established families, which often include five or more children, to move out of the central brownstone blocks into large condominiums to the west and southeast. A new generation of newlyweds is taking their place.\\n''We have 400 to 500 weddings a year in Williamsburg of people between the ages of 19 and 22,'' Rabbi Niederman said. ''Because we don't believe in family planning, immediately after the wedding you're counting the days for your first baby.''   ERIKA KINETZ\\n\", \"Fred Wilpon became a New York real-estate plutocrat, the builder of tall towers along gilded blocks of Manhattan avenues, by excelling at the art of the calculated risk. The grandson of an immigrant Brooklyn street peddler, Wilpon left Bensonhurst on a full scholarship to the University of Michigan, and by age 30, he was back in New York, betting everything he had on reviving faded uptown properties -- and making lavish returns. Later, Wilpon was in the East Village before the boutiques, and he saw potential in Bedford-Stuyvesant when others saw only vacant lots and broken glass. ''He has,'' says his son Jeffrey, ''a nose for this stuff.''\\nBut there are the rare times when he doesn't need it. In Wilpon's business, every so often a proposal comes along that is so lush in its promise of profit and so elegant in its appeal to the deal maker's particular aesthetic that it requires no shrewd discerning at all. Early in 1998, Wilpon received just such an offer from Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.\\nWilpon, now 64, is not simply a real-estate developer. Along with his partner, the publishing heir Nelson Doubleday, he owns the New York Mets, and it was for this reason that the mayor of New York had come calling. Some months before, the mayor had met with George Steinbrenner, the principal owner of the Yankees. Steinbrenner, Wilpon learned, had told the mayor that he hoped a baseball stadium could be built on Staten Island to house a Yankee minor-league team. This made sense. Minor-league baseball attendance was booming as never before -- good for the Boss -- and the northeastern coast of Staten Island was badly in need of an economic fillip -- good for the mayor. What the pair now wanted from the Mets amounted to what people in real estate, like Fred Wilpon, refer to as the ceding of territorial rights. Because the Yankees and the Mets share baseball jurisdiction in the city, the Yankees could not place even a minor-league competitor in the area without the Mets' blessing.\\nOn the face of things, such a blessing would have been highly unlikely. Just a year before, the Mets had hoped to place a minor-league team on Long Island, only to have their efforts blocked by the Yankees. There lingered, as the mayor puts it, ''a certain amount of resentment.'' But the Brooklyn-born Giuliani also knew something about Fred Wilpon that went beyond his existence as a wise man of property. That is, Wilpon had been a childhood habitu\\xc3\\xa9 of Ebbets Field, the ballpark the Dodgers left behind when they moved to Los Angeles in 1957. The mayor says he believed Wilpon was like almost everyone else from that generation of Brooklyn natives -- a nostalgic, still recovering from the loss of the Dodgers. With all that in mind, he threw Wilpon his very fat pitch: you give Steinbrenner Staten Island, he'll give you Brooklyn, and the city will build small ballparks for each of you, design them to your specifications and rent them to you on long-term leases for nominal considerations. By last fall, two pairs of steam shovels had broken ground.\\nIn Staten Island, word that a baseball park was rising in the old railroad yards, along the shoreline near the St. George ferry terminal, excited the locals. Across the Narrows, in the Borough of Churches, the same news was received like something on the order of the second coming. Wilpon immediately became a modern-day duke of Flatbush: he was the hometown boy who made good across the river and then brought the prodigal pastime back to the game's most impassioned fans. The new team was named the Cyclones, and before the season even began, 80 percent of the entire summer's worth of tickets were sold. Wilpon quickly added a thousand more seats to his ballpark, and soon those, too, were going like cheesecakes.\\nAnd yet there were others in Brooklyn, skeptics, to whom Wilpon merited no more than a plangent ''fuhgeddaboudit.'' In place of the Dodgers, Wilpon was serving up these Cyclones, who would slap their singles and ground-rule their doubles against outfits like the Lowell Spinners, the Batavia Muckdogs and the Mahoning Valley Scrappers. The Cyclones were to be a low-level Mets farm team, members of the short season (76 games) Class A New York-Penn League, meaning that Wilpon had presented a fabled city of strivers with just the imprimatur it always dreaded: he was the major leaguer who made Brooklyn into a minor-league town.\\n''They don't look minor league at all,'' Wilpon was saying. he was seated in a luxury box at KeySpan Park, the home of the Cyclones, inspecting his charges, who were displaying competence beyond their classification while drubbing the Vermont Expos. That same observation applied even more accurately to Wilpon's surroundings, for they are what have very quickly made the Brooklyn Cyclones a truly compelling proposition. Wilpon did not simply broker the dual feat of importing the sport of the provinces into New York City while returning professional baseball to Brooklyn. He situated his team in the midst of one of the world's most famous entertainment settings, the five-mile spit of sand jutting into the sea known as Coney Island. The ground on which the young Cyclones were blowing away the baby Expos once held Steeplechase Park, the first of the Coney Island grand-scale amusement compounds. For generations of Americans, Coney Island was synonymous with escape, thrills, adventure, seduction and pleasure, making this among the more inspired locales ever to be seeded with a professional baseball park. The builder built well. The ballpark's graceless corporate nomenclature aside, the ambience is such that everywhere Wilpon turned his head now, baseball was meeting with carnival to winsome effect.\\nJust below him, along the interior concourse that frames the top row of seats in the stadium, vendors hawked soft ice cream, lemonade, handmade Brooklyn Italian ices, cotton candy, Brooklyn beer and Nathan's genuine Coney Island frankfurters. Lining up for these regional delicacies was a crowd that looked decidedly more like New York than the swarm of louts and swells who -- along with unseemly ticket prices -- have made the trip to Yankee or Shea Stadiums a decidedly mixed proposition for members of the metropolitan area's nonexecutive classes. With Cyclones tickets ranging from $5 to $10, here everybody could pay, and a little bit of everybody had. There were young men in do-rags, young women sporting pink hair, Girl Scout troops and their leaders, high-school lads shaded by baseball caps and yarmulkes, college students in hand-held contact with their inamorati and moms, pops and offspring aplenty.\\nWilpon said that ''we don't want to trade on the Dodgers -- we want to fit into this community,'' and at perfunctory glance, the appearances supported the notion. It is true that to Wilpon's right the radio booth was emblazoned with the notice ''Catbird Seat'' in homage to that fabled vernacularist, the Dodgers broadcaster Red Barber. Down on the field, intertwined with the Cyclones ''C'' above the bill on their caps, the Cyclones did sport an iconic white Dodger ''B.'' And the surfeit of advertisements painted on the outfield fences in fact included a tempting proposition from a Brooklyn haberdashery to Cyclones batsmen: ''Hit This Sign . . . Win a Suit!'' -- a shameless little madeleine recalling the old pledge from Abe Stark clothiers on the Ebbets Field wall.\\nAnother swatch of the new barrier, however, promised to remunerate a line drive off itself with a free ride for the whole ballpark on the Wonder Wheel. And right there, in vibrant illumination just beyond the fence in left field, spun the famous Ferris. There was also Astroland, the glittering arcades of Surf Avenue, and brightest of all, that Zeus of roller coasters, the Cyclone itself. To straightaway center field, Wilpon -- and his patrons -- could see strollers along the boardwalk, bathers drying out on the sand, gulls plunging from violet-hued twilight skies and sailboats bobbing in the Atlantic. Around in right was the spiffily repainted 271-foot-tall Parachute Jump tower (sans parachutes, alas). While it is true that KeySpan Park's sound system is both relentless and loud -- a craven feature of so many current professional ballparks -- Wilpon had circled the floodlights in rings of bright neon and sheltered the grandstand under enormous blue-and-yellow-striped beach umbrellas. It was, in the end, a new Coney Island amusement ballpark, and Wilpon was feeling rather proud of it.\\n''Where'd all these people come from?'' he wondered. ''They weren't here last year.'' Then he was riffing on baseball (''It's the American way!''), explaining that the soaring minor-league profits around the country are a function of local ownership and confessing ''a father's pride'' that 39-year-old Jeffrey Wilpon is the man in charge of day-to-day operations for this already lucrative first-year franchise. Wilpon was wearing a checked shirt, butter-soft black loafers and a quantity of brilliantine that swept back the hair from his tanned, lean face. His wife of 41 years, Judy, was a few feet away. Wilpon may now live in a large home on Long Island, but he still serves Dr. Brown's cream soda to his guests, maintains close boyhood friendships -- one old Brooklyn pal is Sandy Koufax -- and enjoys talking about his immigrant Jewish grandmother, who pushed a fruits-and-vegetables cart along the streets of Williamsburg; his father, who presided over a small Brooklyn funeral parlor on Coney Island Avenue; and his sister Iris's husband, Saul Katz, his partner ever since way back when they had nothing.\\nYet although Wilpon is a sentimental person, he has the ears of a man who has heard a lot of requests and the ease of someone with experience in deflecting them. Wilpon is said to be seeking the better part of $500 million from the city to build the Mets a new ballpark in Queens. (His favored design resembles Ebbets Field -- with a retractable roof.) When the matter of these negotiations arose, Wilpon suddenly noted a nifty play by the Cyclones shortstop: ''They pick it! I like it!'' Mention of his relations with his Mets co-owner, Nelson Doubleday, which are said to be strident, produced only a garland for the Cyclones pitcher: ''Hey, this kid's got pretty good stuff!'' Then Guy Conti, a Mets roving minor-league instructor, stopped by to pay his respects, and Wilpon listened avidly as Conti gave impromptu talent evaluations, including testimony to the virtues of the Cyclones' most promising player, the fleet, vividly named center fielder from Puerto Rico, Angel Pagan. Two innings later, Pagan walked, stole second and third and then scored on a wild pitch, generating much jubilation below and more of the same in the owner's box.\\nThat is the usual situation at KeySpan Park these days. All 7,500 seats sell out, the first-place Cyclones win and even when they don't, the audience seems merely ecstatic. Sometimes the play is ragged: exuberant overthrows, haphazard infielding, 55-foot fastballs and undisciplined swinging. But nobody, not even New Yorkers, it seems, heads to minor-league games expecting to see Jackie Robinson, Mike Piazza or, for that matter, Del Bissonette. (You remember Del: ''The Dodgers have Del Bissonette/No meal has he ever missed yet/The question that rises/Is one that surprises/Who paid for all Del Bissonette?'')\\nPerhaps flawless baseball is precisely what the Cyclones fans don't wish for. They go to Brooklyn for many of the same reasons Americans all over the country now attend minor-league games in greater profusion than at any time since the 1940's, the glory days of bush-league ball. There are the KeySpan Park sight lines -- not a bad or distant view in the house. There is harmless between-innings fun, like the dizzy bat race. There is the opportunity to glimpse up close -- and maybe even chat with -- the Mets heroes of yore, Bobby Ojeda and Howard Johnson, who are Cyclones coaches. Best of all is the chance to see the players when their future is in doubt, when they are not wealthy, jaded and truculent but merely young athletes chasing an elusive ambition for $850 a month -- making them a lot like the people paying to see them.\\nOne recent evening, from their seats behind third base, Erika Warmbrunn, a Broadway stagehand, and Peter Guernsey, her stagehand boyfriend, were comparing the experience to ''time traveling.''\\n''It's baseball in the 40's,'' she said, ''when it really was America's game. A-Rod strikes out, and he's still guaranteed how many tens of thousands of dollars per at-bat? Here, a kid strikes out, and somebody who's watching says, 'That's it for him,' and the kid is gone. That's drama. That's real life. All that, and look where we're sitting for eight bucks.''\\nA few yards away, in the Cyclones dugout, was Bobby Ojeda, who went 18-5 pitching for the world-champion 1986 Mets. Eight years before that, he spent a New York-Penn League summer in Elmira, where he made $500 a month and was losing weight eating hot dogs every day and ''sleeping in hotels named after somebody's dog.''\\n''But I remember the realization 'I'm being paid for this!''' he said. ''It was a special, special time.'' Most former major leaguers of Ojeda and Howard Johnson's pedigree would rather be driving a golf cart than riding the Class A buses again, but Ojeda lives close by, in New Jersey, has higher aspirations in baseball and recognizes that he is the human analogue to this version of minor-league ball; literally Class A but more truly First-Class-A. The well-appointed big-city ballpark and the proximity to Shea Stadium make a man feel better about his chances of ''chasing a dream,'' as Ojeda calls the majors. ''These kids were here at the right place at the right time,'' he says. ''This is as good as it gets at this level.''\\nAngel Pagan would agree. Pagan spent last summer in Kingsport, Tenn., and began this one at an upper-level Mets Class A team in Columbia, S.C. He was hitting .300 and felt, therefore, somewhat aggrieved when Guy Conti told him the Mets wanted him to go down and play center field for Brooklyn. But the next time Conti encountered Pagan, even though the 20-year-old was sleeping on a cot in a temporarily converted classroom at a Catholic school in Bay Ridge, he now pleaded to stay where he was. ''I love it here, and I don't want to move,'' Pagan was saying now while signing autographs for an eager throng beside the dugout. ''Last year in Kingsport, there were 1,000 people a night. Here there are 7,500 a night. In Kingsport, you just see trees. Here, there's lots of things.'' Most of Pagan's roommates shuttle between their dormitory rooms and the ballpark, spending spare time doodling on the school chalkboards, but two weeks into the season, Pagan had ridden the Cyclone and explored a little of Coney Island. ''Last year, my mother sent me Latin food Express Mail,'' he says, ''but there are Latin restaurants on Mermaid Avenue. Tonight I had pork, rice and beans -- my favorite.''\\nWhat is revelation for Ojeda and Pagan is rediscovery for Eddy Rosenthal. Rosenthal is a Brooklyn warehouse distributor who went to Ebbets Field as a child, and he thinks the Cyclones are ''the best thing that ever happened to Brooklyn.''\\n''When we were young, the place was mobbed,'' Eddie says. ''It was a carnival on the side streets. There were booths and games and fortunetellers and fireworks. We'd walk on the boardwalk. Then the neighborhood changed, and it got dangerous. You didn't want to go on the boardwalk anymore.''\\nAt the turn of the century, Coney Island was the real crossroads of the world, and its millions of shimmering lights were the first sight of America for arriving European immigrants. In 1897, a Brooklyn entrepreneur named George Tilyou opened Steeplechase Park, the first Coney amusement city, and soon there was Luna Park and then Dreamland, places so fantastic in their design -- a luxurious hotel shaped like an elephant was just the start of it -- that Coney became the physical symbol of the American machine age. Everybody went. In the famed Weegee photograph taken in July 1940, there are a million people on the beach. Yet television, automobiles, shifting demographics and changing public tastes gradually obviated the big Brooklyn amusement parks. The neighborhood became dangerous, with bodies washing up on the beach and gunshots punctuating the evening air that once had been filled with calliope music.\\nNow, with his new stadium, Fred Wilpon was explaining that he hoped to use the minor-league baseball revival to inspire a Coney Island revival. ''I used to come here with my father,'' he said. ''We've tried to integrate the Coney Island we knew and what we know Coney Island will be. The reason for this location, aside from the fact that it's beautiful, was the need for a first-class attraction people could come to with the family at reasonable prices and have safe, attractive fun. It has all the infrastructure. It'll become a vital community again. When the redevelopment of 42nd Street was conceived, they said it couldn't be done. Look at 42nd Street now! I know this area, and I know the potential.''\\nA five-minute walk down Surf Avenue from the ballpark, at his continuously running freak show, Dick Zigun was willing to believe that Fred Wilpon just might be a sort of George Tilyou for the Disney era, an impresario who understood the pleasure-seeking tastes of his time in a way that would once again lure crowds to the Brooklyn shore. Zigun operates the annual Mermaid Parade and the nonprofit concern Coney Island USA, headquartered in his musty little sideshow gallery of sword swallowers and bed-of-nails acts. ''Financially, we haven't seen any change yet,'' he says. ''But in terms of people's impression of Coney Island, there is already a significant change.''\\nNot everybody has been persuaded. Kevin Baker, the author of ''Dreamland,'' a novel set at turn-of-the-century Coney Island, and the leader of historical tours of the area, says he believes that Fred Wilpon is the beneficiary of ''corporate welfare,'' a man making a profit that was handed to him by a lame-duck mayor concerned with ballpark legacies. ''Nobody consulted the public about whether we'd like to pay for these new ballparks,'' he says. ''They're great, but what do people who don't go to the games get? A tax bill. And New Yorkers who do go are being double-taxed because they have to pay for their seats. It's a Coney Island scam.''\\nThe most prominent student of the financial effect of ballparks on their surrounding neighborhoods is a Harvard-trained Smith College economist named Andrew Zimbalist, the editor, with Roger Noll, of ''Sports, Jobs and Taxes.'' Zimbalist says that while it is reasonable for a community to claim there are ''cultural benefits'' to having a minor-league stadium in its midst, ''there is simply no economic argument for the city as a whole to subsidize a ballpark at Coney Island on economic grounds.''\\nNaturally, Mayor Giuliani considers this the worst sort of prevarication. ''Andrew Zimbalist is Castro's economist,'' he says. ''He does not understand a capitalist economy.'' The point, the mayor explains, is that the ballpark ''allows people to rediscover Coney Island. It's a way of showing off Coney Island so people come back for other things besides baseball.'' As to why there was no referendum for taxpayers to say whether or not they wanted to build Fred Wilpon and George Steinbrenner these new minor-league ballparks, the mayor's answer is: ''Because they would have voted it down. That's why you need a leader. Somebody who has some vision.'' His legacy, he says, will be forging ''the anchor of the economic redevelopment of two neighborhoods that desperately need it.''\\nIn the sleek Fifth Avenue skyscraper where his company, Sterling Equities, keeps its headquarters, Fred Wilpon considered this modern phenomenon of municipalities building ballparks for team owners to use in private enterprise. ''I know what economists say,'' Wilpon said, ''but I also know what the history is when baseball teams vacate a city.'' It was then suggested to him that, in this case, nobody was leaving. The minor-league teams, in fact, seemed to want nothing more than to come to New York. Wasn't the city needlessly paying for him to turn a profit? Couldn't he have built his own ballpark and still made out fine? Wouldn't he maybe even have forgone some of the profits just for the satisfaction of helping out the old neighborhood?\\nWilpon was on his way to a meeting. Pausing in his building's Italian marble lobby, he stood there, in a pinstriped bespoke suit stitched for him by a tailor who has also outfitted several presidents, and considered his motives with the Cyclones. Since this is baseball today, they are a mingle of pleasures and profits. ''It wasn't all money,'' he said. ''I have a passion for this. I would have done it if I knew we'd break even.'' Then he mused: ''If I knew we'd lose money, would I have done it? Probably. Yes. On an emotional basis, not on a business basis.''\\n\", \"IN the window of a video store on Bedford Avenue in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, hangs a poster for the 1968 film ''Chitty Chitty Bang Bang,'' in which a young boy and girl enter a land curiously devoid of children. Seeing the offending visitors, the townspeople gasp in horror, and the young pair are soon spirited away by a gaunt, long-haired man in tight black clothes.\\nA similar gasp could be heard two months ago in Williamsburg, home to many gaunt people in tight clothes, when a Bedford Avenue storefront that had long housed the local art supply store reopened as Sam & Seb, the neighborhood's first baby store.\\n''It's deplorable,'' said Sean Kennerly, a Williamsburg writer who watched in despair as the stenciled words ''Discount Art Supplies'' disappeared under a coat of shocking pink paint. ''It's one more sign of the deterioration of the neighborhood. You always figure there are places for people who want to have kids. Like over in Park Slope.''\\nBabies have long been a fixture in the area's Latino, Polish and Hasidic communities. But the pioneering artists and those who followed them to Williamsburg in the last 20 years seemed to float above such corporeal concerns as pregnancy and child-rearing. They were known for pierced navels and creative facial hair, for cigarette-filled afternoons and all-night roof parties.\\nTheir coolness made headlines across the country, drawing others to the industrial-chic streets and causing The Utne Reader to declare Williamsburg the third hippest neighborhood in America (after the Lower Garden District in New Orleans and the Inner Mission District in San Francisco). A sexy convergence of grit and glam, Williamsburg was hardly a place for miniature pudgy people who slobbered food down their shirts and were too young to smoke.\\n''I moved here 11 years ago from Park Slope to get away from all the babies,'' said an actor-contractor who asked that his name not be used. ''You walked up Seventh Avenue, and you had to wiggle yourself to get past stroller after stroller.''\\nOnce, he and others like him were safe. As recently as five years ago, babies were a relatively rare sight in hipster Williamsburg. Then, about two years ago, they started to pour out of the warehouses and onto the sidewalks.\\nSigns of change abound. The Williamsburg Northside Preschool on North Fifth Street, which started with three children in 1999, is expecting more than 100 in September and will move to a bigger space this week. The number of children taking classes at the Stable, a local dance studio, increased from three or four in 1997 to 72 today, and the studio offers pre- and postnatal yoga. Tops on the Waterfront, a neighborhood supermarket, reports increased sales of baby oils, soaps and organic foods.\\nEven people having babies have been taken aback by the explosion. Kate Murphy, a 36-year-old advertising director who lives in the area, recalled seeing ''the odd stroller on Bedford getting weird looks from the Calvin Klein models,'' and when she became pregnant last year, she said, ''I didn't know that this was the right place necessarily to have a baby.'' Watching preparations for the new baby store, she thought, ''I'll be your only customer.''\\nTo Ms. Murphy and others like her, the store is a godsend. It's not just the snakeskin bibs, the Jane's Addiction onesies or the installation art of multicolored baby heads in the window that make Williamsburg's new parents feel at home. It's also the relief at finding a local hangout where they can meet like-minded others.\\n''New mums come here, and they just hang out for hours,'' said Simone Manwarring, one of the owners. ''They sit here and breast-feed. They know we're not going to say, 'You can't use our bathroom.' It's sort of like a safe zone.''\\nMs. Manwarring, a local art exhibition coordinator, opened the store with Amanda Williamson, an artist neighbor. The two first-time mothers got the idea after too many treks to Manhattan in search of both baby items and contact with other mothers. Nevertheless, even they were surprised by the response when they posted a sign-up sheet inviting new mothers to bring their babies to the shop for a get-together.\\n''I thought we'd have maybe 3 mothers, but we got 18,'' Ms. Manwarring said as her 15-month-old son, Sam, toddled about on the store's brightly colored floor tiles. A few days later, the list shot up to 30.\\nPeeling Paint Isn't Baby-Friendly\\nOn the morning of the first ''new mums'' meeting (so termed by Ms. Manwarring, an Australian, and Ms. Williamson, who is South African), women spread out on the floor, sipping mint tea and guava juice, playing with babies or rubbing bellies that contained them. They heard presentations by Shirly Weiss, a holistic nutritionist, and by Philippa Woolley, who runs the Stable.\\nAfterward, the women discussed the drawbacks to breeding in the 'hood: the raised eyebrows; the power plants, waste transfer stations, and other pollution sources; the artists' lofts whose flaking paint and soaring windows are hardly child-friendly.\\n''Our landlord said babies don't belong in Williamsburg,'' said Ms. Murphy, sitting on the floor with her daughter, Isabel, who is just a few weeks old. ''It's the kind of building where a lot of artists live, and I think she didn't want to deal with it.''\\nMs. Woolley nodded. ''We had a home birth,'' she said, ''but we didn't tell our landlords.''\\nStill, these new mothers are not about to leave Williamsburg. Most lived here long before becoming pregnant, and they don't mind being icebreakers. They are in their 30's, they are finished with the dating scene, and they are less concerned with the neighborhood's cool quotient than with fighting for more parks and better education. Williamsburg's public schools score badly on citywide tests, and a parents group has received a $25,000 grant to start a local charter school, although they have yet to get approval from the city.\\nIt is not hard to spot more subtle changes on local streets. The staff at Hello Beautiful, a new, psychedelically painted hair salon, entertain clients' babies during haircuts. Wythe Avenue's sleek, silver Relish diner, the locus of many a film shoot, most recently the one for ''Angels in America,'' recently invested in a wooden highchair. The Brooklyn Brewery on North 11th Street holds a smoke-free Friday night open house at which babies make their way around the gleaming beer tanks as their parents swig microbrew and shoot pool.\\nDiscussions about babies in Williamsburg inevitably turn to the subject of gentrification. But longtime residents point to escalating real estate prices as the true culprit, and note that many of the local residents having babies are artists who have lived there for years. Many of them are also the owners of the places that helped make the neighborhood hip in the first place.\\n''All the bars the hipsters hang out at, the L Cafe, Pete's Candy Store, the Girdle Factory, Earwax, their owners are all having babies,'' Ms. Manwarring said. ''Everyone who owns all these businesses that they like, all the people they admire in the neighborhood.''\\nReminders of Mortality, or of Suburbia\\nHere is Williamsburg's take on babies, based on comments that Steve DeRiseis, Ms. Manwarring's husband, heard last month as he stood on a ladder painting the baby store.\\nThose who made snide ''There goes the neighborhood'' comments were typically young and male. Longtime residents told him they were glad about the change, especially that the space was not going to become another new bar. Perhaps most surprisingly, childless women in their 20's loved the idea.\\n''It's amazing,'' said Ms. Manwarring, whose long red hair and upturned nose make her look more like a bright-eyed schoolgirl than a grown-up mother. ''There's so many young women who come in here who don't have babies and aren't close to having babies. And they buy stuff for the baby they'll have one day. They go nuts. They go absolutely gaga.''\\nThe singer Bjork, who is pregnant, spent 45 minutes in the store one day, buying not baby clothes but 11 finger puppets. Ms. Williamson found this interesting. ''I didn't think Bjork had 11 fingers,'' she said.\\nYoung men are a harder sell. To many, babies are a drooling refutation of their commitment-free lives, a reminder of their mortality. Not to mention that strollers and baby bottles look frighteningly like suburbia.\\nSitting surrounded by motorcycles at a sidewalk table at Relish, Mr. Kennerly, 34, insisted that he had nothing against babies per se. ''The Polish and Hispanics have been raising their kids here for years,'' he said. ''That doesn't bother me. It's fine to have procreative impulses as long as you don't inflict them on the neighborhood.'' What bothers him about what he calls the ''yuppie babies'' is the ''assertive cuteness'' imposed on them by their parents.\\n''I think upper-middle-class people have a much more narcissistic involvement with their kids than poor people,'' said Mr. Kennerly, who grew up in Texas and Colorado (and whose discussion of babies was sprinkled liberally with curses). ''It's the gurgling and the cooing that I can't stand. People just don't let their kids be. They're convinced that their kid is the most amazing thing that ever happened on the planet. But I didn't realize how dire the situation had become'' until the baby store opened.\\n''When the baby stores open,'' he said, ''you know the bourgeois has the neighborhood firmly in its grasp.''\\nMontgomery Knott, a lanky music producer who favors beach hats and low-slung jeans, found it bizarre to see strollers on industrial streets that were recently the domain of prostitutes, though he added, ''At some point I'm sure it was pretty bizarre to see children on the cobblestones of SoHo.''\\nHe wasn't bothered by the babies until a couple of months ago, when he bought a new apartment. A couple with a 5-month-old moved in next door, and suddenly the late-night, video-enhanced ''listening parties'' on Mr. Knott's mattress-strewn floor were interrupted by knocks on the door and appeals for quiet.\\n''What are people thinking?'' he said. ''Do they think they're moving into Park Slope or something? I'm interested as a homeowner in the value of my space, and I know that families bring in value.'' But there are limits. ''Anyone,'' he said, ''even in the suburbs, should be allowed to throw a blowout party.''\\nHighchairs Amid Smokers\\nLast weekend at Sam & Seb's opening party, as strollers gridlocked outside and pink and white balloons strained against their strings, a tall man with a mohawk, a nose ring and a silver front tooth watched his small son and daughter run around. A woman with tattooed arms and a guitar sang upbeat children's songs, courtesy of ''Music for Aardvarks,'' a local children's music program. An infant in a Sex Pistols T-shirt crawled across the floor.\\n''It's kind of hard to believe: we grow older and have kids,'' said Dan Siegler, a new father and the owner of the L Cafe, an art- and artist-filled establishment ever since it opened a decade ago next to the L train stop.\\nNow Mr. Siegler was at Sam & Seb, handing out fliers announcing the L's new children's menu, which started last week and lists crayons, highchairs and ''Baby-ccinos'' (steamed milk with foam served with animal crackers).\\nNot all of Mr. Siegler's employees share his vision.\\n''When we talk about where the cafe is going,'' he said, ''I'm talking about a kids' menu, and they're talking about D.J.'s and sangria.'' Part of that is attributable to a generation gap: he is 39, and many of his employees are still in their teens. But Mr. Siegler also sees baby stores and children's menus as part of a natural evolution, much like the changes that transformed SoHo and Greenwich Village.\\n''Every few months there's this fear that it will no longer be everyone's little stretch of bohemian paradise,'' he said, referring to a recent series of Starbucks scares. ''Ultimately, that's going to happen, and ultimately the people who gentrify the neighborhood are the ones who complain loudest about the degree to which it gets gentrified.''\\nBut it's not just about ideology. There are more practical objections to the baby boom.\\n''They're messy and they're annoying,'' said Amy Chin, a 23-year-old waitress at Diner, a local restaurant. ''It's a smoking bar, and people bring their babies in there at 11 at night. Who does that?''\\nWhile Williamsburg parents don't necessarily subscribe to traditional mind-sets about the hours babies should keep or the places they should frequent, everyone seems to agree that babies and smoking don't mix.\\nThe father with the mohawk and nose ring at Sam & Seb was wearing a nicotine patch. Mr. Siegler, who quit smoking four years ago, says smoking is the stickiest issue at his cafe as the highchairs are pulled out more and more often amid the all-day blue haze.\\n''I would love to make it a no-smoking restaurant,'' Mr. Siegler said. ''People say we'll lose all our smoking clientele, but my feeling is those people would be replaced by people who don't smoke and want to eat and spend money rather than sitting for three hours over a cappuccino.''\\nTo that, Mr. Kennerly said, ''My reaction is just: 'Yuck.' ''\\nIn ''Chitty Chitty Bang Bang,'' the adults-only spell is finally broken when hordes of children rise from their hiding places in the sewers, causing mayhem in the royal court as they reclaim their rightful place. While Williamsburg's change of heart may be slightly less dramatic, it is nevertheless happening as the baby-to-hipster ratio threatens to approach parity.\\nWith so many babies parading around, is Williamsburg in danger of losing its ''third hippest'' status?\\n''You know, I hope it does,'' said Mr. Siegler, the owner of the L. ''Hipness has long become uninteresting. It's an uninteresting thing to aspire to. If you spend all your time trying to preserve that, then how cool can you possibly be?''\\nAside from a few hostile comments, new parents say the neighborhood has a friendly, small-town feeling that seemed to increase when they had their babies.\\nSome say they feel a deeper connection to the neighboring ethnic communities. ''The Mexicans next door, they just can't believe that this white person is having a baby,'' said a very pregnant blond woman at the new mothers' meeting. ''They talk to me now.''\\nAnd that actor who moved from Park Slope to escape the strollers? There was a reason he didn't want his name used. Not long ago, he and his girlfriend built a small wooden annex to their bed. They needed to make room. For a baby.\\n\", \"An guide to cultural and recreational goings-on around the state this week.

Young children, up late.\\nThe phenomenon is clear to anyone who visits the city's streets, subways, stores and fast-food restaurants after 10 p.m. Summer is prime time for the wee hours, and the city that never sleeps is filled with children who seem not to sleep enough.\\nLate August is also when school looms and, experts say, when parents most need to ease their children into earlier bedtimes. But schoolbooks were a distant thought at 1:30 a.m. on a recent Thursday in Times Square.\\nOn that night, seven cousins, 3 to 15, transformed the corner of 42nd Street and Seventh Avenue into a playground as they laughed, shouted and swung from low-hanging scaffolding. Supervising the rowdily friendly bunch was their grandmother, Shirley Ann Quintero, and her husband, Jose Saavedra.\\n''When I was little, my dad used to bring me out to play the arcades in Times Square, so I decided to bring my kids out and do the same thing,'' said Ms. Quintero, who lives in the same building as her charges on the Grand Concourse in the Bronx. The special occasion justified the late hours, she said.\\nAs the Quintero clan swung from the scaffolding, Ahmed Farraj, 10, and his family entered a nearby subway station. They had just been to see the movie ''Signs'' and were headed home to Sunset Park, Brooklyn. Despite the late hour, Ahmed was not tired, he said.\\n''You know why?'' he asked. ''Because the lights, they're too shiny, and it looks like it is not even dark yet. It looks like it's the morning.''\\nIn Astoria, Queens, Yehia Ghazi, a gregarious Egyptian immigrant, also understands the powerful draw of the city's bright lights. ''I love the night,'' he said. His children, Khalid, 7, and Khloud, 5, are also developing a taste for it. ''They go to bed at 12:30 or 1'' on school nights, he said. ''If you wake up at 7:30, that's enough sleep.'' During the summer, he added, they are up even later.\\nThere have been no studies of the sleep habits of the youngest New Yorkers. Impressions can be misleading, too, and not just because a late night may be a rarity rather than a routine. A child playing outside an apartment building late at night will be seen by hundreds; a suburban child logging onto the Internet from a bedroom is nearly invisible. Also, naturally, there are plenty of New York City homes where early bedtimes are alive and well.\\nStill, experts offer several reasons why early bedtimes for children may be scarcer in New York than elsewhere.\\nFor starters, city dwellers have always been night owls. ''There's more competition for sleep'' in urban areas, said Dr. Judith Owens, director of the Pediatric Sleep Disorders Clinic at Hasbro Children's Hospital in Providence, R.I. ''It's much more of an artificial environment. There's stuff going on 24 hours a day. Stores are open, parents are working. There's just much less reliance on your natural circadian rhythms.''\\nAt most hours of the night, New Yorkers can buy books, rent videos, work out, eat Korean barbecue, even be arraigned in Manhattan Criminal Court, which is open all night three nights a week.\\nFor workers, too, New York is a sleepless town. ''New York City has more 24-hour operations than your average city,'' said Dr. Jack Connolly, president of Shiftwork Consultants, a firm in Port Washington, N.Y., that advises around-the-clock businesses.\\nBodega and transit workers are obvious examples, but old-school manufacturers, like the Domino Sugar plant in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, also tend to run all night. Even for lawyers, secretaries and others who work regular hours, ambitious New York is just not a 9 to 5 place.\\n''The economy doesn't close down at night,'' said Mitchell L. Moss, director of the Taub Urban Research Center at New York University. ''So what's happened is that many parents do not come home until late in the evening and that's when they spend time with their kids, doing chores, helping with homework or shopping.''\\nThese urban characteristics are accompanied by other, more general social pressures that can mean less sleep for children, from the trend to more homework to the multiplying number of computer games and television shows. Combined, these forces raise the specter that bedtimes for city children, already late, may grow later.\\nBusy Parents, Busy Children\\nDr. Laura Popper, an associate professor at Mount Sinai Medical School and a pediatrician who primarily deals with upper-middle-class families in her private practice, often observes busy parents trying to carve out time to spend with equally busy children.\\n''If you're an investment banker and work incredibly long hours,'' she said, ''something's going to have to give.'' Even for parents who achieve what experts advise -- giving elementary-school children regular bedtimes and 9 to 11 hours of sleep a night -- the task can be exhausting.\\nLiz Swig, who lives on the Upper East Side, feels lucky if she can get her sons, Simon, 11, and Oliver, 7, to bed at 10 and 9:30, respectively. They do not frequent the streets or play many video games; their lives are just busy. Between the two, there's tennis two days a week, soccer, art class and Hebrew school. Last year, Simon had up to an hour and a half of homework as a fifth grader at the Horace Mann School, in Riverdale in the Bronx. Oh, and there is the small matter of eating dinner.\\n''There's no time for them to try to just chill out,'' Ms. Swig said. ''Conceptually, children need their sleep. But it's very hard to do it.''\\nBy the time Simon's daily whirlwind is done, it's almost 10, but Ms. Swig allows him to stay up a little longer.\\n''Don't you think he deserves downtime?'' she asked. ''Don't you think he deserves the equivalent of his glass of wine a day?''\\nLike the Swigs, many parents, especially in middle-class neighborhoods, list a litany of school and extracurricular activities. But even when they are done, bedtime is not necessarily quick in coming. ''I see kids who really are burdened with hours and hours and hours of work,'' Dr. Popper said. ''They really can't wind down from it, so they're awake.'' Experts say quiet time before bed is important for good rest.\\nThe Night Shift\\nDaysi Mel\\xc3\\xa9ndez can understand these pressures. A Honduran immigrant raising three children on her own, Ms. Mel\\xc3\\xa9ndez works 4 to 10 p.m. three days a week in a Laundromat in Park Slope, Brooklyn. On her days off, she insists that the kids be in bed by 9. But when she works, it is not until 10:45 or so that she picks them up at the baby sitter's house in Bushwick, Brooklyn, where Ms. Mel\\xc3\\xa9ndez lives.\\nShe says she knows this pattern is not good for the children, that they may not be able to concentrate in school. ''The poor kids go to bed at midnight, by the time they take a bath and I change them,'' she said. ''It's hard, but it's necessary. It's temporary, just for now.''\\nBut there is nothing temporary about the work schedule of Mr. Ghazi. ''All my life I work nights,'' he said, adding that he always will. When his family first joined him from Egypt in 2000, he drove a bakery truck on the 2-a.m.-to-noon shift. The only time he had for his family was at night before work, and the kids often stayed up until he left. He would teach them English words or tell them stories in Arabic.\\nNow Mr. Ghazi works in an East Village restaurant, Sahara East, from 5 p.m. to 4 a.m. He sees his children when they come home from school and on Monday, his day off. But the family's late nights continue.\\nOn a recent Monday evening, Mr. Ghazi and his wife, Amal Monsor, were in their small three-bedroom apartment on a quiet Astoria street. It was 11 p.m., and the two children were sitting on the couch, watching an Egyptian movie on satellite television. The living room was decorated with images of Ramses and Nefertiti, enlarged passages from the Koran and eight clocks.\\nIn the next hour and a half, Khalid played the video game ''Fighting Force 2'' on his Playstation, studied his Pok\\xc3\\xa9mon cards and tuned in stations on his Walkman. Khloud lay on her parents' bed, flipped through Dr. Seuss's ''Foot Book'' and played with stuffed animals, including a gorilla, a baby giraffe and an eyeless Kermit the Frog.\\nThe children were energetic and adorable, but they began to falter by 12:30 a.m. Drifting toward the bedroom where they share a colorful bunk bed, they began looking through a collection of picture books.\\nAt 12:50 a.m., back in the living room, Khloud announced she wanted to go to sleep, but with a catch. She wanted her older brother to come to bed too. Khalid was not tired, but Mr. Ghazi ordered him to go with Khloud wait until she fell asleep and then come back. Khloud collapsed on the lower bunk, face down. Khalid leaned against the yellow bunk ladder, reading ''Huggly's Snow Day.'' The eyeless Kermit sat in the corner. About 1:15, after a brief return to the living room when his sister had dropped off, Khalid went to bed.\\nSuch patterns are familiar to Dr. Owens. She has studied the sleep habits of lower-income children from the Providence area, and said her findings also apply to New York and other big cities with large immigrant populations.\\n''A large number of these kids have parents working two jobs or three jobs, and many working a night shift,'' Dr. Owens said. ''There isn't anybody to supervise bedtime, and bedtime in the families isn't really a structured concept.''\\nSuch a pattern can be a problem. A recent study of 187 elementary-school children in two-parent homes by Dr. Jodi Mindell, associate director of the Sleep Disorder Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, shows that children's sleep is affected in families in which at least one parent does not work a typical 9-to-5 day.\\nSummer in the City\\nOn a recent hot evening in Washington Heights, kids swarmed outside, riding scooters, sitting on stoops, eating Chinese takeout and playing basketball.\\nThe Heights is one of the city's most densely populated neighborhoods, so for every kid in the street after midnight there were probably many more tucked in bed. But the sheer number of kids outside in this area on a steamy night makes every corner look like a day care center. On some blocks, speakers blare merengue or bachata so loud from windows that it is hard to imagine anybody inside the building asleep.\\nYou are never too young to join this party. About midnight on a recent Sunday, three strollers stood unoccupied at Audubon Avenue and 178th Street. They belonged to Shaunoly P\\xc3\\xa9rez, 2; Justin Minaya, 1; and Aliyah Beltr\\xc3\\xa9, 1. With encouragement from her mother, Valerie Malav\\xc3\\xa9, Aliyah wiggled her hips to a merengue song by Sergio Vargas. The children's parents and grandparents egged her on, and Aliyah smiled.\\nAsked why Shaunoly was not in bed, her mother, Charo P\\xc3\\xa9rez, was defensive. ''Today's the only day she's breaking night, so I can spend some time with my parents,'' she said, saying Shaunoly's usual bedtime is around 10.\\nThis scene is at once strange and familiar to Jose Beltr\\xc3\\xa9, Aliyah's father. He grew up in Washington Heights and remembers wishing his parents would go upstairs so he could go to sleep. But since he moved, things are different. ''I live in Florida and I don't see my neighbors,'' he said.\\nHis wife, Ms. Malav\\xc3\\xa9, added, ''There's not really that hanging out that you do here.''\\nA few blocks away, Henry S\\xc3\\xa1nchez made the rounds on his scooter, despite the occasional admonition from his father, Luis, to stay nearby. Many members of the S\\xc3\\xa1nchez family were gathered outside their Audubon Avenue building.\\n''Let's consider something,'' Mr. S\\xc3\\xa1nchez said when asked about the street scene. ''The heat. Not everyone has their little air-conditioner.''\\nChurch is another reason for staying up late. In Washington Heights and other immigrant and minority neighborhoods, some children attend Pentecostal churches on weekday evenings. The Rev. Adalberto De Jesus of the Church of God, on Crotona Avenue near East Tremont Avenue in the East Tremont area of the Bronx, said that years ago he scaled back his Wednesday services to end no later than 9:45 p.m. He wanted the children, usually about a third of his 30 or 35 Wednesday worshipers, to return home.\\nBut, he said, many other churches are not as conscientious. ''I don't think they realize the full negative effect that is happening,'' he said. ''On the other hand, if you're going to weigh the positive and the negative, there are more positives than negatives from the effect church has on children.''\\nStaying up late in the summer is not a big problem, Dr. Mindell said, as long as the child does not have to wake up early for camp or day care and gets enough sleep over all.\\nBut, she warned, children who make a quick switch as school starts will have troubles. ''Parents need to realize that the transition cannot happen overnight from a summer sleep schedule to a school sleep schedule,'' she said. She compared it to jet lag after flying from California to New York.\\n''With some of these kids,'' she added, ''it's more like they're on Hawaii time.''\\n\", \"Correction Appended\\nAt Engine Company 204 in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn, the police used two vans to cart away 12 protesters who had invaded the firehouse to keep it alive. At Engine Company 212 in Williamsburg, protesters rushed in and jammed pieces of lumber to prop open the door. One man chained himself to the bumper of the fire truck, and others sat down in front of it. Eight people were arrested.\\nAfter months of debate and legal battles, the city closed six fire companies yesterday in Brooklyn, Queens and Manhattan. Several of the closings went smoothly, although bitterness and sadness lingered outside the buildings' front doors. But confrontations in Harlem and Brooklyn exposed emotions so raw that their intensity surprised the police officers and fire officials on hand to keep order on the overcast Sunday morning.\\nThe six companies -- four in Brooklyn, one in Manhattan and one in Queens -- had been ordered to close down and cease responding to radio calls at 0900 hours, or 9 a.m. The city had long argued that in these six cases, other fire companies nearby could respond to emergencies just as quickly, and the overlap of coverage was too expensive in such perilous financial times.\\nThere were hugs, tears and somber goodbyes among residents and firefighters at the firehouses where the order was quietly followed. At Engine Company 209 in Bedford-Stuyvesant, the closing barely interrupted the firefighters' morning coffee and treadmill workouts.\\nAt Engine Company 36 in East Harlem, however, protesters chanted angrily. Waving banners reading ''They Go, We Die,'' they lined up in front of the house and blocked firefighters from parking the fire truck inside.\\nMayor Michael R. Bloomberg, speaking to reporters in Forest Hills, Queens, reiterated his contention that the closings would not pose a safety threat to local residents. He said that all of the firefighters were being reassigned and that the six companies had been chosen carefully by fire chiefs because ''all of them are reasonably close to other firehouses.''\\nThese were the first firehouse closings in the city in more than a decade, and the mayor faced political opposition, lawsuits and no small criticism over them. But the mayor, who was lightly booed at two Memorial Day parades yesterday in Queens, has maintained that this is a politically tough but necessary measure to balance the city's budget.\\nClosing firehouses has never been easy. In 1991, four days after Mayor David N. Dinkins ordered the controversial closing of Engine Company 294, in Richmond Hill, Queens, two brothers died in a house fire nine blocks away. Rudolph W. Giuliani seized on the issue when he ran against Mr. Dinkins for mayor in 1993, and reopened the firehouse shortly after he became mayor.\\nOn Saturday, a man rammed a white van into the front doors of four firehouses in Brooklyn. One firehouse door was jammed shut, preventing firefighters from responding to two calls. None of those firehouses were among the ones scheduled to be closed.\\nAs of yesterday, officials had not found the driver or speculated on his motive. But there was talk among firefighters that the incident could have been an attempt to keep the city from closing the four Brooklyn firehouses by disabling others that would assume their duties.\\nThe 20 people who were arrested yesterday were charged with criminal trespassing and disorderly conduct, said Firefighter Robert Calise, a spokesman for the department.\\nAt the firehouses that drew protests, demonstrators began arriving before 8 a.m., carrying coffee cups, waving signs and pushing baby strollers.\\nAbout 200 people gathered outside Engine Company 204 in Cobble Hill. There were parents, politicians, activists. There was a Sept. 11 widow, and there was the actor Steve Buscemi, a former city firefighter who lives in Brooklyn.\\nA handful of demonstrators began to voice outrage that the firehouse was being closed. Others put down their coffee and began chanting along. Speakers began lambasting Mr. Bloomberg's decision, and the gathering grew heated. Just before 9 a.m., protesters linked arms in front of the building, preventing the firefighters from leaving. A fire captain from the house, Brenda Berkman, stuck her head out a window and joined in the criticism of the mayor.\\nBy 11:15, the protesters were storming the firehouse and opening the large door so others could enter. Just after noon, police officers arrived and began making arrests.\\nAt Engine Company 212 in Williamsburg, there were about 100 protesters by 8 a.m., chanting in English, Polish and Spanish and setting up sidewalk barbecues to grill hamburgers. Two conga drummers arrived and began beating out rhythms.\\nSuddenly, Paul Veneski, 38, of Williamsburg, an unemployed truck driver, slipped into the firehouse through an open cellar door and opened the garage's large red door. Other protesters -- among them Bronislawa Hupalo, a rail-thin 80-year-old -- charged in and struggled to jam it open with discarded lumber. .\\nMr. Veneski then chained himself to the fire truck. His 12-year-old daughter, Jennifer, cheered him on. Later in the three-hour standoff, she offered her father hamburgers through a small space in the door.\\nApparently, trying to save firehouses runs in the Veneski family. Mr. Veneski's father, Adam Veneski, a local grocer, stormed this very firehouse when it was threatened with closing in 1975, the family said.\\nAt Engine Company 36 in East Harlem, about a dozen protesters chanted against the closing. A sarcastic ''For Rent'' sign on the door listed some of the building's assets: ''Eat-In Kitchen, Covered Parking, Sliding Pole.''\\nAlthough unhappy to see them go, the protesters cheered the firefighters as they carried out their gear.\\nLee Decker, 35, a firefighter with Engine 36, said that many firefighters from the company, both active and retired, spent the night at the house, rehashing memories and deciding who would keep communal possessions bought with their own money, including a washer-dryer, dishwasher, refrigerators, couches, televisions, stereos, VCR's and an extensive collection of exercise equipment.\\n''They're breaking up a big family here,'' Firefighter Decker said.\\nIn Sunset Park, Brooklyn, a small group of teary-eyed firefighters and residents gathered outside Engine Company 278 at 9 a.m., not so much in protest as in resignation. As they hugged each other, Brian Horan, 48, of Sunset Park, a 13-year veteran with the company, loaded his belongings into his car.\\n''I think it's a disgrace to the members of the force who died in 9/11,'' he said. ''It's a slap in their face.''\\nThe scene yesterday seemed just as poignant at Engine Company 261 in Long Island City, Queens. It shared a firehouse with Ladder Company 116, so the house itself would be staying open.\\nAt 8:30 a.m., a handful of firefighters there sat dolefully on the bumper of their truck and listened to local Democratic elected officials criticizing Mr. Bloomberg and Gov. George E. Pataki for cuts in financing.\\nAt 9 a.m., Deputy Fire Chief John Acerno conducted a somber roll call, saluting their efforts and ''dedication, loyalty and many sacrifices.''\\nBy the end, some firefighters were in tears.\\nCorrection: May 28, 2003, Wednesday  A picture caption on Monday with an article about the closing of six fire companies in New York City gave a misspelled surname in some copies for Assemblywoman Joan Millman's chief of staff, who was among those who protested outside Engine Company 204 in Brooklyn. She is Corrina Freedman, not Friedman.\\n\", \"Those who live by Bedford Avenue and South Fourth Street in Brooklyn had their 11th-mile welcoming all set for the New York City Marathon runners yesterday. Salsa music blasting from a top-floor window filled the street, volunteers lined up to hand out water and spectators held up signs for the runners.\\n''Victoria, the runners,'' Maria Molina told her 5-year-old daughter, who sat in a small lawn chair, as the first female runners passed.\\nFor Molina and others who live nearby, the marathon is more than an annual event. It has become a neighborhood tradition.\\nSeveral of her family members gather every year to hand out water and cheer on the runners. Molina's mother makes chicken soup and hot chocolate for the neighbors, and they play the salsa music from Molina's home.\\nMolina's father first began hydrating runners with a hose 20 years ago, then became captain of the 11th-mile water station, which runners pass just after the Williamsburg Bridge. Her brother-in-law, John Alfaro, is now a co-captain.\\n''It is something we grew up with,'' Molina said. ''It is something we do every year. It is part of our neighborhood.''\\nMelissa Gonzalez, 20, has been volunteering at the water stations on Bedford Avenue since she was 7. Gonzalez's grandmother, who died two years ago, first signed her up as a volunteer. Gonzalez said the marathon played a big role in the neighborhood.\\n''You see more and more people coming out to help,'' she said.\\nDown the street from Gonzalez, about 20 members of the El Regreso Foundation, a drug recovery program, dispensed water. The men held orange tape to keep spectators from walking into the runners' paths and cheered the runners.\\n''Keep going, baby!'' one Regreso volunteer yelled. ''Just a little longer guys!''\\nHanding out water was a new experience for Juan Yambo, who has been a resident of the Regreso program for eight months.\\n''I was not especially involved in these types of activities,'' he said. ''It's good for us.''\\nYambo found inspiration from the wheelchair athletes, who were the first to go by his station. ''I was impressed because even with their impediment, they can accomplish so much,'' he said.\\nGabrielle Steiner, a member of the Hasidic community in Williamsburg, stood by South Fifth Street watching with her daughters Miriam Gluck, 22, and Bella Englander, 23, who were each pushing a stroller. Steiner remembered watching the marathon with her own daughters in strollers. She said she watched the marathon from different locations within Williamsburg to get a feel for the community.\\n''Each year I move up a couple of blocks,'' Steiner said.\\nJesus Molina, Maria's uncle, has watched the marathon from Bedford Avenue since it started going through, he said. Although the people who gather to watch there are still mostly Latino, especially Puerto Rican, he said he had seen the community diversify.\\nNils Almquist, 29, who moved to Bedford Avenue by South Fifth Street last year, had 11 friends over to watch with him outside his apartment building. Almquist and his girlfriend, Tara Swanson, set up a table with bagels, pomegranates, mimosas and bloody marys. They were already making plans for next year.\\n''Next year there will be a little more preparation,'' Swanson said.\\nFor Priya and Sandhya Seshan, who have been living in Williamsburg for six years, the marathon is a time for sisterly bonding. They usually have breakfast on marathon day and watch together from Bedford Avenue.\\n''All right, 222!'' yelled Priya Seshan, 29, who plans to run the marathon next year. She said she liked to motivate the runners.\\n''I focus on the people who get tired, I call out their names,'' she said. ''Maybe it gives them more strength to keep going.''\\nMayra Laro tried to give the runners strength with oranges. For the third year, Laro offered the runners sections of oranges from the sidewalk. She stood with her 2-year-old daughter and her 5- and 11-year-old sons by South Sixth Street. She woke up early yesterday to cut 75 oranges.\\n''I like to help them and I want my children to continue the tradition,'' she said in Spanish. ''Maybe in the future they can run in it, too.''\\n\", \"Correction Appended\\nSabato F. Catucci stalks the piers on the Red Hook waterfront in Brooklyn, where he has built a thriving business handling cargo containers, lumber, coffee and cacao beans. Mr. Catucci, the owner of American Stevedoring, has plans for a liquor distribution center on Pier 12, where his company would unload beer and spirits bound for Brooklyn, Queens and Long Island, bringing hundreds of new jobs to Red Hook.\\nBut last month, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey told him it would not extend his lease of Piers 6 through 12 beyond April, while it explored ''alternative uses for the property.'' Though Representative Jerrold Nadler says he may have persuaded the Port Authority to grant a temporary reprieve, the longer-term fight to save Mr. Catucci's maritime operation is just one skirmish in a battle raging through Red Hook and neighboring Gowanus over the future of the hardscrabble area.\\nThe small manufacturers, distributors and businesspeople who have helped revive that stretch of the Brooklyn waterfront in the last decade say the city and the Port Authority are writing off the area's maritime and industrial base in favor of a future filled with luxurious waterfront apartments featuring spectacular views of Manhattan and Governors Island. They say rents have risen sharply and speculators are holding industrial properties off the market in the belief that the city will rezone the area for residential development -- a move they contend will make it all but impossible for many of these companies, and thousands of jobs, to survive.\\nThe struggle mirrors what is happening in Long Island City, Queens, and Greenpoint and Williamsburg, Brooklyn, where gentrification and a shift to residential zoning are under way, worrying manufacturers who provide blue-collar jobs.\\n''This is in many ways the most complex land-use battle in the city,'' Deputy Mayor Daniel L. Doctoroff said of Red Hook. ''You've got competing uses, with tradeoffs between jobs, waterfront access, housing, retail jobs and industrial jobs. It requires a very textured approach.''\\nHe and other city officials say that a good number of Red Hook's buildings sit unused or underused, so the city and Port Authority are studying the area to determine how to make the transition from an industrial waterfront to an office-based economy. They will not say whether they envision luxury apartments, though they say they favor a mixed-use neighborhood where residential and commercial developments coexist.\\nBut the small-business owners say coexistence is a pipe dream. A boom for luxury apartments will price them out of the neighborhood, they say, and the new developers and residents will have little tolerance for the gritty realities of a working waterfront.\\n''People who live in Red Hook depend on these jobs; they're willing to put up with the truck traffic and the congestion,'' said Igor Katsman, vice president for operations for Snapple Distribution, which rents warehouse space and employs 250 workers. ''But when you start putting up $500,000 condominiums, those people don't want trucks on the streets.''\\nIn the meantime, Mr. Katsman said, he fears that the uncertainty over the area's future will put him out of business. ''Nobody wants to give us a long-term lease because they're all speculating that the zoning will be changed to residential,'' he said.\\nMr. Doctoroff said that the city and Port Authority expect to complete their latest study on the future of Piers 6 through 12 sometime this month. He also said that Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg plans this spring to issue the city's long-awaited policy on preserving industrial space citywide.\\nBut there is an increasing fear at Community Board 6, whose district includes Red Hook, that the Bloomberg administration has a different vision for the neighborhood. Last month, the city granted a variance to convert four floors of a six-story industrial building to 152 luxury apartments. The Red Hook-Gowanus Chamber of Commerce filed a lawsuit opposing the variance, saying it would touch off a conversion craze.\\n''It feels like Red Hook is being dismissed as the viable maritime and industrial community that it is,'' said Phaedra Thomas, the chamber's administrator. ''They've determined that its future is as a luxury waterfront community.''\\nUntil the 1950's and 60's, much of shipping industry in New York Harbor docked in Red Hook and South Brooklyn, where longshoremen, warehouse workers and truckers lived in the neighborhood and walked to work. Most of the jobs disappeared as the Port Authority built a modern container port on the other side of the Hudson River in Newark and Elizabeth, N.J., a move that is still seen as a profound betrayal in Brooklyn.\\nBut in the last 10 to 15 years, the Red Hook waterfront has come back to life as light manufacturers, artisans, distributors and woodworkers moved into abandoned industrial buildings and shipping resumed on some of the piers. According to a survey by the South Brooklyn Local Development Corporation, the number of businesses in Red Hook climbed to 457 in 1999, from 291 in 1991.\\nMr. Catucci said he moved 110,000 shipping containers at the Red Hook container port last year, up from 18,211 in 1994. He established the biggest port for cacao beans in the world, although it has lost ground in recent years to Camden, N.J. and Philadelphia. He said he employed roughly 750 workers, including many from the nearby Red Hook Houses, where unemployment runs as high as 30 percent.\\nThe Port Authority has complained that it spends millions of dollars a year subsidizing a barge that transports the containers from Brooklyn to New Jersey. But Mr. Catucci says he pays about $6 million of the $10 million cost of the barge and is developing plans for beverage and food distribution centers that would import goods bound for Brooklyn, Queens and Long Island, not New Jersey. He says that could eliminate the need for the barge in five years.\\nIf the city decides that in the long run the piers could be better used for housing or recreation, he said, he will gradually move his business to the largely deserted South Brooklyn Marine Terminal. But he has lost business while the Port Authority kept him in limbo over his lease -- and the city, he said, could lose hundreds of jobs, once again to New Jersey.\\n''I'm not going to stand in the way of progress, but I've got to know where I'm going,'' he said. ''We lost 400 jobs at Domino Sugar last week. I don't want to lose these jobs, too. You'll never get them back.''\\nA senior city official suggested that the loss of American Stevedoring could be offset by new jobs at a passenger ship terminal, an Ikea store and a Fairway supermarket all proposed for the area.\\nRobert Hughes, manager of the Erie Basin Bargeport, where 500 people work on barges and tugboats and at a beer distributor, said it was critical that the city retain Red Hook as its last working waterfront aside from Howland Hook in Staten Island. Tom Fox, president of New York Water Taxi, said the growth of ferries would continue only if there are places in the harbor to berth, repair and service boats.\\n''There's a mile or more of waterfront property that, depending on the whims of elected officials, might be taken out of maritime use,'' Mr. Hughes said.\\nA year ago, Carnival, the big cruise ship company, worked out a proposal with the local community board and Mr. Catucci to build a $100 million passenger terminal at Pier 7 for the Queen Mary 2 and other ships, because of overcrowding at the city's terminals on the west side of Manhattan. But the city rejected the plan. Yesterday, Kate Ascher, an economic development official, said the city would invest $250 million over the next 10 years in passenger terminals, including two berths in Red Hook, although she acknowledged that she did not know where the money would come from. In the meantime, the city offered Carnival a temporary berth at Pier 7.\\nCommunity leaders worry that if the city does not move more quickly on a permanent terminal, Carnival will follow Royal Caribbean, another cruise line, to Bayonne, N.J. ''We expected the departure of Royal Caribbean would be a wake-up call for the city,'' said Giora Israel, a Carnival vice president. ''But so far we haven't received a viable proposal.''\\nBruce Batkin, an owner of the building at 160 Imlay Street that was granted a residential variance, said he thought the city's study indicated that the waterfront was well suited for residential development, despite the lack of public transportation. Across a short stretch of water, he said, the city plans to create a resort and conference center on Governors Island.\\n''We think this should be a template for successful coexistence of commercial and residential,'' he said.\\nJeffrey Levi, chief executive of John's Gourmet, a high-end food manufacturer that employs 70 people a block away from Imlay Street, is not convinced. The people moving into expensive apartments, he said, will have concerns about truck traffic, noise, smells and Dumpsters. He pointed out how the Gillies Coffee Company in Sunset Park, another Brooklyn industrial neighborhood undergoing gentrification, was fined by the city last year after a resident complained about the smell of coffee.\\nWith the area's future so uncertain, Mr. Levi said he is considering moving to New Jersey.\\n''For me to expand, it means I would have to invest another quarter of a million dollars,'' he said. ''I'm not sure it makes sense if I'm going to have baby strollers rolling down the block.''\\nCorrection: March 2, 2004, Tuesday  An article on Feb. 4 about development along the Brooklyn waterfront misstated the role of Community Board 6 in a now-defunct proposal by Carnival, the cruise ship company, to build a $100 million passenger terminal in Red Hook. It has generally supported the idea, but it did not negotiate a deal with Carnival.\\n\", \"A guide to cultural and recreational goings-on around the state this week.

Last year, Chris Skroupa and John Wilson sold their apartment in Hudson Heights, in northern Manhattan, and moved to Chelsea, where, as a gay couple, they already spent most of their time socializing.\\nBut they soon discovered that the neighborhood was changing faster than they expected. Home prices were rising, and many of their friends were moving to Hell's Kitchen, a few blocks west of Times Square.\\nIn restaurants that used to be almost exclusively gay, they noticed an influx of straight customers, often with children in strollers. On a recent Saturday, Mr. Skroupa and Mr. Wilson went out for brunch and ''literally less than one-third of the restaurant was gay,'' Mr. Skroupa said last week, pausing between bench presses at a New York Sports Club on Eighth Avenue.\\nFor at least a decade, Chelsea, on the West Side just north of Greenwich Village, has been the epicenter of gay male life in New York. Gay bars, novelty shops and coffee shops (notably, Big Cup, on Eighth Avenue), have drawn pilgrims from all over the country. Its reputation is such that its residents are sometimes called Chelsea Boys, and certain buildings have nicknames like the Gay Dorm or Fire Island West. But in the classic pattern of gentrification -- first come pioneers, then come families -- Chelsea is once again evolving. As mostly straight families move into Chelsea, gay residents are now gravitating toward Hell's Kitchen and beyond.\\nMr. Skroupa and Mr. Wilson said they are renting while they decide whether to set down roots. ''We didn't want to get into a situation where we were locked into a place like the Village, which has lost its edge,'' Mr. Skroupa, 44, said. The strollers, he said, were reaching a ''critical mass.''\\nIn the 2000 census, the area represented by Chelsea's central ZIP code, 10011, had the highest concentration of male same-sex households in New York, according to Gary J. Gates, a demographer, who with Jason Ost, a researcher, compiled ''The Gay and Lesbian Atlas.'' Chelsea's concentration of male same-sex households is seven times the percentage in New York overall, according to an analysis of census data by the sociology department at Queens College.\\nBut a raft of new condominium developments and rising prices in nearby neighborhoods have drawn more straight residents to Chelsea. In the past four years, developers have built or renovated about 2,000 condo and rental units, most too big for singles. With ''condos with doormen and two and three bedrooms, automatically come the families and the straight people,'' said Leonard Steinberg, a broker with Douglas Elliman in Manhattan, who is himself gay.\\nOlder buildings where gay residents represented 75 to 80 percent of the population five years ago are now at least 50-50, Mr. Steinberg said. Some buildings now have more straight residents than gay, he said.\\nWhile some gay residents may gasp at straight stroller gridlock, it should come as no surprise. Twenty years ago, when gay men and women began to leave the West Village for Chelsea, straight families moved in to take their place. Now, as Chelsea's gay incumbents disperse to Hell's Kitchen and Washington Heights as well as Fort Greene and Williamsburg in Brooklyn, they are again being replaced by straights.\\nGay pioneers ''have been trailed all the way up the West Side by straight couples with babies and Volvos,'' said Darren Sukenik, a broker with Douglas Elliman, who is gay and lives at 270 West 17th Street, a condo built in 1991. In the last six months he has sold six apartments in his building -- all to straight couples.\\nFor many gay residents the change gives rise to mixed feelings. On the one hand, the arrival of straight neighbors makes Chelsea less of a ghetto. On the other hand, a safe haven of sorts is lost. ''My friends and I talk about this all the time,'' Mr. Skroupa said. ''This is what we wanted, but in a way we're losing our little nook in the world.''\\nAlthough gay couples are also starting families, Chelsea's identity was built largely on the gay singles scene, with nightclubs and bars still drawing gay men from around the city. The appearance of spruced-up playgrounds and child-friendly restaurants has thus taken on symbolic weight.\\nPerhaps most striking was the opening of a warehouse-size Buy Buy Baby on Seventh Avenue, near 25th Street, a year and a half ago. ''It was a watershed moment,'' said Gil Neary, president of DG Neary Realty, who has sold real estate in Chelsea for 20 years.\\nWhen Abby and Rob Goldstein bought an apartment at the Chelsea Mercantile, a condominium a block from the store, Mrs. Goldstein worried that the neighborhood might not be convenient for children. ''But the day we came to do our walk-through, we saw a sign that said 'Buy Buy Baby Opening Soon,' '' said Mrs. Goldstein, whose 23-month-old son, Max, was born a month after the couple moved. ''So I said, I guess it'll be fine.'' Now, said Jamil Canal, the Mercantile's resident manager, the 352-unit building is home to 60 children, most with straight parents.\\nFor some residents, the baby boom signaled the end of an era. ''I did notice that when I started to get run over by those double-truck strollers, it was probably time to get out of Chelsea,'' Ted Davis, a 40-year-old magazine art director, said with a chuckle. He moved to Hell's Kitchen last year and this fall will pick up again, this time for Williamsburg.\\nSome lament the dilution of a supportive gay community. ''The young gay kids who are marginalized from around the country come here and then find they are priced out of the neighborhood,'' said Johnnie Tiedemann, who was shopping last week on Eighth Avenue.\\nSince 2000, the median price of an apartment in Chelsea has increased by 57 percent to $1.18 million, according to the Douglas Elliman Manhattan Market Report prepared by Jonathan Miller, an appraiser. At the same time, the average rent for a one-bedroom apartment in Chelsea is $2,477, according to CitiHabitats, the Manhattan brokerage firm, a level that prices many newcomers out of the neighborhood.\\nRichard Silvera, 23, who was sitting in Big Cup last week, said he wanted to move to Chelsea after graduating from New York University but couldn't afford it. ''Young gay people don't have the money but need the perks of a gay neighborhood the most,'' he said. ''You have just come out, you are trying to figure out who you are and who your social circle is.''\\nGranted, it's not just affluent straight buyers and renters who have driven up prices. When the Chelsea Mercantile opened in 2000, some brokers took to calling it the Gay Millionaire's Dorm because of its high sales prices. But turnover has brought in more straight buyers. Linda Gertler, a Corcoran Group agent, said that of 14 apartments she has sold in the Mercantile since 2002, 11 have gone to straight buyers.\\nFor those who have been in the neighborhood for a while, straight buyers have meant opportunities for profit. ''The gays came in and gentrified the neighborhood, and it's become a much nicer place to live,'' said Christopher Mathieson, a broker with JC DeNiro & Associates. ''And they're now cashing out and making a lot of money.''\\nSome straight families, meanwhile, say Chelsea now has a healthy fusion of lifestyles. ''Our hallway in the Mercantile is an amazing combination of young couples, gay people, families, older people, professionals and people who are at home,'' said Sophie Miodownik, who moved there three years ago with her husband, Aron, and their children, Ella and Zack, now 5 and 3.\\nGay residents who feel ambivalent about living in a gay-identified neighborhood welcome the mix, too. ''We certainly didn't pick the neighborhood as a gay cultural center,'' said David Dabill, an advertising executive who bought a two-bedroom apartment with his partner last year. Mr. Dabill said they had never even been to a gay bar in Chelsea. Straight families in the building, he said, ''are kind of a nonissue.'' If anything, he said, ''it comes in handy when you're looking for someone to look after the cats.''\\nSome newcomers hope the neighborhood won't change too much. Catherine Davis and her husband, Stephen, who are expecting their first child, fled the Upper West Side two years ago for London Terrace, a complex of rental and co-op apartments on 23rd Street. The day they moved in, Ms. Davis recalled, ''there were these two men decked out and spruced up in leather G strings on Harley-Davidsons, with huge wings, walking up 23rd Street. I was like, 'Oh, my God, I'm so glad I'm not living on the Upper West Side anymore.' ''\\nJeff Monford, a public relations executive who lives in the neighborhood, said, ''I'd like to think that mixing it up in the 'hood helps open minds and hearts and increases tolerance in general.''\\nStill, he said, communities that have undergone similar transformations, like Greenwich Village, retain their gay character long after the arrival of straight yuppies. ''The idea being that once we've been there, we leave a virtually indelible print,'' he said.\\n\", 'ONE month ago today, Richard Oceguera, 35, and Thomas Koveleskie, 33, celebrated their Massachusetts wedding of last spring with a party on the roof of their home on South First Street in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Sixty people attended this handmade ceremony, which sampled elements from early Christian services -- both men are Catholic -- blended with vows they had written themselves, followed by disco dancing to Duran Duran, Book of Love and late Blondie.\\nAs the sun set, the lights honoring the Twin Towers were lighted, along with those of the Empire State Building, and a flock of pigeons tumbled skyward from the roof of a nearby tenement (a happy coincidence). John Gillespie, a neighbor, made a toast, which he recalled the other day. \"I said that this was a transformative event both for the guests, and the building,\" Mr. Gillespie said. \"It marked a new beginning for all of us, and it felt like a blessing on the building.\"\\nThis celebration, its setting and the coincidental atmospherics -- those lights, the pigeons -- underscore Williamsburg\\'s 21st-century incarnation as a bedroom community for Manhattan professionals. The residents of 150 South First Street, the luxurious new condominium development where Mr. Oceguera and Mr. Koveleskie bought their 900-square-foot two-bedroom for $440,000 in July 2003, are prototypical of the area\\'s new citizens; many are couples looking to start a family.\\n\"We\\'ve already had a naming ceremony on the roof, for one of the two babies born in the building,\" said Mr. Gillespie, who is president of the condo board at 150 South First (his day job is medical director at Pfizer in Manhattan). \"And there\\'s another wedding planned.\"\\nNo longer a haven for artists -- or even \"artists\" -- Williamsburg feels more like Georgetown in Washington, than the East Village, to which it has been compared. At 8:45 on any given weekday morning, Bedford Avenue is a river of well-scrubbed young professionals pouring toward the L train and their city jobs across the river. (The Bedford Avenue gloss is so powerful that the developers of 150 South First Street, which is at the corner of South First and Bedford, marketed their property as 299 Bedford Avenue.) By 10 the strollers are out, careering along the same strip or parked at Fabiane\\'s Cafe.\\n\"I never thought of myself as a \\'Williamsburg kind of guy,\\' \" said Mr. Oceguera, who is director of business development at Rent-Direct.com, an online-service that connects would-be renters with landlords; he and Mr. Koveleskie had been renting together in Brooklyn Heights for four years.\\nMr. Oceguera was crisply dressed in a blinding white shirt and zippered chocolate brown Agnes B. sweater from Paris -- he and Mr. Koveleskie had just returned from a honeymoon in Italy and France -- and talking passionately about family and roots; he sees Williamsburg as fertile ground for both.\\n\"Even though this is our starter home, our first purchase,\" Mr. Koveleski said, \"we want to start a family here. We\\'ve hit all the milestones -- home ownership, marriage -- and the last one is children. Our neighbors expect it of us.\"\\nThe men say their neighbors, mostly straight couples in their 30\\'s, are sharing parenting and adoption group news. \"We all seem to have a lot in common,\" Mr. Oceguera said.\\nIt took one month for all 32 units here to sell, said Helene Luchnick, an executive vice president at Douglas Elliman who marketed the building.\\n\"At that time there was absolutely nothing else for sale in Williamsburg,\" Ms. Luchnick said. Its developers had planned the building as a rental property, until they saw the state of the market. It was Ms. Luchnick who suggested they build the rooftop deck, fitness center and kitchen. Prices are about $500 a square foot, and rising. Mr. Oceguera and Mr. Koveleskie\\'s apartment was just reappraised, they said, at about $550,000.\\nPatrice Mack, a broker at Elliman who sold the building with Ms. Luchnick, was surprised by the monolithic homogeneity of her clients. \"It was weird, we thought it would be artists or people from the area,\" she said, \"but instead it was this group from Manhattan. They even had the same stuff. Do you remember the Aerosole \\'Dollyanna\\' shoes from \\'Sex and the City?\\' \" she continued. \"All the girls were wearing those.\"\\nOld Williamsburg, the one with the Latin flavor, is still here: the vacant lot opposite Mr. Oceguera and Mr. Koveleskie\\'s living room terrace is filled with pumpkin vines. The \"artists\" are represented too: a juice bar around the corner has a street sign with the words Haight-Ashbury painted on its galvanized steel walls (there\\'s even a VW bus emblazoned with peace signs). But this couple mostly ignores such signage on their walks to emporiums like Uva\\'s Wines and Bedford Cheese down the block; both men love to cook.\\nThey met by chance six years ago in a Chelsea restaurant. A few nights later, Mr. Oceguera, new to the city from Chicago, was dialing around haphazardly for a dinner date. Mr. Koveleskie, vice president for equity and fixed income research at BBVA Securities, was the only one who answered his phone. It was 9 p.m. and he was working late. \"We\\'ve been inseparable ever since,\" Mr. Oceguera said.\\nOn May 24, Day 6 of legalized marriage in the commonwealth of Massachusetts, the men were the 350th same-sex couple to be married, they said. The state requires a three-day waiting period, but you can get a waiver, which they sought. The elderly male judge who granted it urged both to \"ignore the small-minded folks out there,\" as Mr. Oceguera remembers it. Mr. Koveleskie\\'s father told him, \"I looked up the definition of love in the dictionary, and it didn\\'t say it was only between a man and a woman.\"\\nMr. Oceguera broke in. \"Not to mention it\\'s always good for the economy when two gay guys get married,\" he said.\\n', 'Yesterday was the kind of morning when you poured water onto the Corn Flakes. No sense running to the corner bodega if you were out of milk. The TV was showing temperatures that would look right on the jerseys of quarterbacks and kickers. And there were rumblings of a storm to come.\\nAll through the windows, if you were lucky enough to have them, came fat beams of double-crossing sunshine, promising warmth that would not be delivered, not yesterday and not for a long while. It was cold out there.\\nStill, you couldn\\'t call it unexpected. It was mid-January already, late January really, and the forecasters were finally calling for the first big snowstorm of the season, one to make up for lost wintertime.\\n\"We\\'re in for, pretty much, a doozy for the weekend,\" said Michael Silva, a National Weather Service meteorologist. \"So far we\\'ve been pretty lucky, we\\'ve been pretty mild.\"\\nThe weather service was calling for a storm to cover everything over, with Arctic air masses taking advantage of a dip in the jet stream and low pressure moving across the Ohio Valley, and for snow to start falling on Saturday afternoon and to leave 12 to 15 inches on the ground, ending by Sunday afternoon. There was a blizzard warning, too, for winds stronger than 35 miles an hour to blow that snow around. The best advice, the written warning said, is \"TO STAY INDOORS.\"\\nAcross the city, people seemed to welcome that advice.\\n\"There\\'s a storm?\" asked a clerk at Reel Life, a video store in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. \"Excellent. I\\'m going to watch some football, smoke some weed and chill out.\"\\nRenee Price, a student at New York City College of Technology, who was walking down Jay Street yesterday in a hat, scarf and long coat, was making indoor plans, too.\\n\"I\\'m going to go outside and pick up the paper at 6 a.m., sneak back inside and read,\" Ms. Price said. \"The heat is already set, the mood is right and the coffee will be on at 7.\"\\nThose with work to do were less enthusiastic, but they too bowed to the storm. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority said it would suspend nearly all planned subway construction over the weekend.\\nFreshDirect, a company that delivers groceries, was making backup plans. \"If our employees can get here, we\\'re going to trudge through the snow,\" said Steve Druckman, a company spokesman.\\nAnd real estate brokers were canceling open houses.\\n\"People are saying, \\'If you have somebody to show to, call me and I\\'ll go,\"\\' said Steven Rutter, managing director of the Corcoran Group\\'s office in Park Slope. Property owners, he said, \"don\\'t want people traipsing in with snowy boots, snowy strollers, snowy kids.\"\\nThe forecasters could be wrong, but Mr. Silva seemed confident.\\n\"Most of our models are in agreement; it doesn\\'t look like they\\'re going to be wrong,\" he said.\\nYeah, but what if they are?\\n\"We could see 8 to 12 inches of snow, or we could see more.\"\\n', 'THE industrial corner of Brooklyn located about five minutes from the East Village by L train is known as a haven for Orthodox Jews and art school hipsters. In the 1990\\'s, it became home to an alternative gallery district. But over the past few years, Williamsburg, Brooklyn has also evolved into something else: a full-fledged theater district. Call it Off Off Off Broadway.\\nA decade ago, there were loft parties and shows by the fledgling Bindlestiff Family Cirkus, a neo-vaudeville troupe that now has a national following, but that was about it. Now, within this ten-block radius of nondescript warehouses, there are more than a dozen spaces devoted to theatrical work, showcasing nearly every type of theater, dance or performance. Indeed, the area is becoming so popular, that some habitu\\xc3\\xa9s are worried that they will soon be priced out. \"When I saw the bodega across the street turn into a realty office last week, I started to get nervous,\" says Michael Gardner, a co-founder of The Brick Theater.\\nPerhaps. But for now, Williamsburg is having its avant-garde moment, showing off edgy work and barely advertising it, confident that the in-the-know 20- and 30-somethings will still show up.\\nThe Charlie Pineapple Theater on North Eighth Street, with its dedicated young founders, its tiny makeshift atmosphere and multiple personalities, is an example of one type of new venue. The theater\\'s founders, Sarah and Mark VanDerBeets, are a disarmingly earnest couple devoted to dramatic revivals. Sarah, a dancer, and Mark, an actor, met at college in Santa Cruz, Calif. in the early 90\\'s and moved to New York in 2000, settling in Williamsburg after a brief stay in a Brooklyn Heights sublet and then a year or so in East Harlem. A year and a half ago, they found this building, turning one of the front rooms into a theater and the back studio into an apartment where they now live with their two-year-old son, aptly named Charlie.\\nThe 45 plush red seats were donated by a theater in Alabama, the shiny wood floors by their \"fantastic landlords\" and the name, from an enigmatic card that Ms. VanDerBeets found among her grandfather\\'s belongings, that read: \"Ask for Charlie Pineapple.\" The couple raised the money for the space using credit and savings, and they sustain it through donations and local advertisements (the program for the theater\\'s recent production of \"Of Mice and Men\" could serve as a Williamsburg Yellow Pages). Mr. VanDerBeets says of their advertising scheme: \"We\\'re pretty heavy on the sandwich board and chalk.\" Also to raise money, they sublease one of the front rooms to a lighting designer and by day offer dance and yoga classes in the theater.\\nNext month, they plan to stage Sam Shepard\\'s \"True West,\" which had an abortive run two years ago at the couple\\'s first theater, a block away. That space was shut down, midseason, for fire-code violations. (Now they point repeatedly to the new theater\\'s clearly marked exits.)\\nThe Brick, a 75-seat theater on Metropolitan Avenue, is a production by another energetic duo, Robert Honeywell and Michael Gardner. The space, which was at one time an auto-body shop, shows dance and theater as well as a monthly performance series called \"Brick-a-Brac\" featuring local performers. This summer they hosted the Hell Festival, which included original work in addition to readings of Hell-related texts like \"Faust;\" the Moral Values Festival -- listed as a performance festival for the morally questionable, morally perverse and morally bankrupt -- is on deck for next summer, inviting work from synchronized swimmers as well as playwrights.\\nWilliamsburg is also headquarters to two experimental theater groups cultivated by members of the now legendary Wooster Group: Radiohole and Collapsable Giraffe. Collapsable Hole, as the groups have named their shared space, is a spare industrial box except for all the techie gadgetry. A dazzling array of video equipment makes possible shows like Collapsable Giraffe\\'s \"Meat Is Floating By,\" in which company members acted out a nonlinear play in a camera-lined room that had been constructed onstage.\\nThe audience, seated on risers not far from the action, caught only occasional glimpses of the performers, but had constant view of them on a live video feed. At one point, the garage door leading out to the street was thrown open and the audience had to figure out that the show was over. When they wandered out to the deserted street, the actors had vanished except for a message on the sidewalk in chalk that signaled their departure. The group\\'s next show, \"Letters from Earth,\" an experimental theater piece inspired by interviews with conspiracy theorists and by Mark Twain\\'s novella \"Letters from the Earth,\" in which Satan writes to Michael and Gabriel about how strange humans are, opens in March.\\nWith no signage, the Hole is also almost impossible to find if you don\\'t know where you\\'re going. While the theater sometimes shows up in listings magazines, many other Williamsburg spaces publicize only through insider e-mail blasts from sites like Jeff Stark\\'s Nonsense NYC (www.nonsensenyc.com).\\nThe exception may be the neighborhood\\'s most successful venue, Galapagos Art Space,the Williamsburg version of P.S. 122 and its Show Nightclub rolled into one, with a reflecting pool at the entrance and fresh lilies in the restrooms. The club\\'s two stages feature musicians, films, performance art and variety shows, like the long-running Monday Night Burlesque.\\nMeanwhile, the choreographer Elizabeth Streb, who has been presenting what she calls \"action work\" in New York City since 1976 and is the recipient of a MacArthur grant, has taken up residence in a huge warehouse on North First Street. The Streb Laboratory for Action Mechanics, or SLAM, has 30-foot ceilings, from which hangs a flying trapeze.\\nSLAM is nearly always open to the public. On one recent week day, a drop-in audience member was treated to rehearsals of Ms. Streb\\'s company\\'s next show. Dancers were flinging themselves onto spring-based tumbleboards and bouncing off like rubber balls. Ms. Streb watched from a table as dancers tried running from opposite directions and throwing themselves onto the boards simultaneously without killing each other.\\nThe performance space Monkey Town will reopen in May after renovations are completed on a its fancy new space, which boasts a minimalist Japanese aesthetic. Montgomery Knott, the handsome, hatted man who runs that space, says his new theater will seat only 32 in order to give audiences that lovely feeling of being nearly alone with artists. \"Anyone who\\'s gone to a huge rock show or a giant museum exhibit knows that unless you have the perfect seat or the backstage pass or the preview ticket, your experience is colored by your level of discomfort,\" explains Mr. Knott. \"In our space, every seat is privileged by our economy of scale.\"\\nOn the other end of the size spectrum, a 7,500-square-foot club called Supreme Trading opened across from Charlie Pineapple in October with a pledge to stage all manner of entertainment, including theatrical work. And as recently as late January, the concert organizer Todd Patrick (better known as Todd P.) announced on his Web site (http://toddpnyc.com) that he is starting a new, as yet unnamed, \"DIY art/show\" space in Williamsburg.\\nSome worry that Williamsburg\\'s success as a new theatrical hot spot contains the seeds of its own demise, as the neighborhood becomes increasingly expensive.\\n\"Ultimately, and sadly, the struggle boils down to finances,\" said Marisa Beatty, the Executive Director of Williamsburg Art Nexus (or WAX), which recently closed after five years. \"I believe that the work of even the most promising creators suffers under the pressure to be the \\xc3\\xbcber-manager -- choreographer, costume designer, public relations director, dancer, producer and technical director -- of your own show. Our cost of living directly feeds this cycle by making it nearly impossible to outsource these roles.\" While Ms. Streb has eight years left on her lease, most of the others\\' leases expire in the next two or three years, by which time, many believe, certain regions of Williamsburg will have been rezoned into residential areas. That proposed change would increase the already rampant construction of condominium apartments, and the march of the MacLaren strollers.\\nTheater companies and producers in search of cheaper rents have already begun to move further and further east along the L line to Bushwick (referred to as \"East Williamsburg\" by residents in denial). It\\'s a different, less diversified scene -- more slapdash, more rock \\'n\\' roll. The two most important of these spaces are Asterisk and OfficeOps (a converted office building best known for its \"Rock \\'n Rollerskate\" parties).\\nIt\\'s probably just a matter of time before Bushwick becomes the new Williamsburg, just as Williamsburg has arguably become the new Lower East Side.\\nMs. Huggans of Collapsable Giraffe is philosophical about the her group\\'s near-inevitable exile: \"We love our space in Williamsburg,\" she says, \"but the second we can no longer find a good dive bar to drink at after rehearsal, we\\'re out of here.\"\\n', 'UNTIL recently, residents of Brooklyn\\'s Victorian Flatbush have been all dressed up with no place to go. No place in the neighborhood, that is.\\nBut that seems to be changing with the slow but steady evolution of Cortelyou Road, the seven-block-long commercial section of a street that cuts through Flatbush between Coney Island Avenue and East 17th Street. Benches and new street lamps are on the way, as 99-cent shops, bodegas and hair parlors increasingly share turf with new businesses catering to a vast ethnically diverse clientele, affluent new arrivals and young families yearning for more service.\\nEstablished businesses like the Flatbush Food Co-Op and the Greenmarket, which has expanded, have been joined by new restaurants, a cafe with a bookshop, and an antique shop, Cortelyou Vintage, which is scheduled to open Wednesday at 1118 Cortelyou Road. It will have mid-20th-century furniture and decorative accessories intending to cater to new residents coming from places like Park Slope and Williamsburg.\\n\"I\\'m looking to capture the young hipsters who want unique furniture and who are not going to go to Levitz and buy new,\" said the owner, Nicole Francis, who works as a financial planner and lives in a 10-room Victorian house nearby. \"The key market is couples with young children.\"\\nShe pays $2,000 a month, or slightly more than $2 per square foot, for a 950-square-foot retail space, with a bonus 850 square feet of garden, according to Dr. Edmund Lee, the building\\'s owner, who grew up in the neighborhood and whose Chinese immigrant parents operated a hand laundry nearby.\\nCatherine Hickey, director of economic development for the Flatbush Development Corporation, said store rents on Cortelyou Road are typically $1.50 to $3 per square foot. Vacancies are up, she said, as leases expire and landlords look for higher rents.\\nMost buildings on the street are brick, about 20 feet wide and three stories high, and were constructed around 1930, according to the Department of City Planning.\\nAsking prices for commercial properties for sale are picking up after stagnating for decades. A 4,140-square-foot building at 1502 Cortelyou Road with four residential units and a ground floor bar, the Cornerstone, is on the market for $1.3 million, according to Jan Rosenberg, a principal in Brooklyn Hearth Realty Ltd., a brokerage firm, and president of Friends of Cortelyou, the five-year-old group dedicated to improving the street. Monthly rent for the bar space is in excess of $4,000.\\nThat price is higher than most on the road, where closing prices are typically in the mid-$600,000\\'s. A three-story structure at 1410 Cortelyou Road is in contract for $650,000, according to Ms. Hickey of the Flatbush Development Corporation. The space is now a temporary headquarters for a transportation project. The buyers, Salvatore and Matteo Amato, are brothers who plan to convert it to a restaurant and bar. Their family has owned the adjacent San Remo pizzeria since 1976.\\nWilliam Del Quaglio, who paid $245,000 for the building at 1416 Cortelyou Road about seven years ago, is now in contract to sell it for $675,000. Mr. Del Quaglio used to run the bagel shop on the ground floor.\\nLike Mr. Del Quaglio, the Amato family and Mr. Lee, many property owners have long associations with the neighborhood. Sales of buildings most often take place through word of mouth and without brokers.\\nCortelyou Road is anchored at one end by the Q line subway station, an Associated supermarket and a Duane Reade, and at the other end by charmless auto body shops lining Coney Island Avenue.\\nIn between, the street has a kind of Norman Rockwell, small-town allure to it, complete with a fire company (Da Pride A Flatbush), a red-brick school, a library, rambling old colonnaded houses, a playground, massive flowering chestnut trees in full bloom and unusually wide sidewalks that invite a pleasant amble. A Mexican grocery store has pi\\xc3\\xb1atas hanging from the ceiling.\\nNamed for Jacques Cortelyou, a 17th-century tutor and surveyor who had a hand in establishing the town of New Utrecht, the street had originally been called Avenue C, according to the Brooklyn borough historian, Ron Schweiger. Around the turn of the 20th century, wealthy executives began moving into mansions on streets with lettered names and many were given upper-class British names like Argyle, Buckingham, Rugby, Marlborough and Stratford.\\nUntil 1930, a trolley ran along Cortelyou Road. Small businesses thrived until the 1960\\'s, when commerce started to slide and crime increased. Improvements were slow to germinate as new arrivals in $1 million Victorians or well-priced co-ops went elsewhere to shop and dine out.\\n\"We didn\\'t have a place where people came together and which created a sense of neighborhood,\" said Ms. Rosenberg of Friends of Cortelyou, which hopes to woo a bank and children\\'s clothing store to the area. \"And because the commercial strip was so small, I felt that only a few different stores could help create that change.\"\\nChange has gained momentum in the last 18 months. On weekend nights there are waits for a table at the popular Picket Fence restaurant, which opened a year ago at 1310 Cortelyou Road. Its bustling back garden was recently made twice as large, and now seats 50 with plenty of room for families with strollers, according to the owner and chef, Graham Meyerson, who formerly cooked at the Union Square Cafe and who lives nearby. Dishes include a pecan crusted pork chop at $15, warm garlic potato chips at $5, turkey meatloaf for $12, and a house burger for $8.\\nAbout 100 people from all over the city turned up at a recent book party at Vox Pop, 1022 Cortelyou Road, a new cafe and book shop that serves fair-trade coffees, $4 vegetable sandwiches and $6 organic turkey baguettes and whose motto is \"Books, Coffee, Democracy.\"\\nThe owner, Sander Hicks, who lives over the shop with his wife, Holley Anderson, a singer-songwriter, and newborn son, Coleman, runs a print-on-demand operation on a balcony over the bar. He was also the publisher of \"Fortunate Son,\" a biography of George W. Bush, under his own imprint, Soft Skull Press.\\nMr. Hicks got a month\\'s rent free when he opened in November, welcomed by a landlord who wanted a tenant who would help improve the street. This kind of response to the community seems typical of the new Cortelyou, he said.\\n\"Even the food co-op is now open until 11 p.m.,\" Mr. Hicks said. \"They listen to their customers.\"\\nThe street will get added exposure in the next few months when Picket Fence and Mr. Meyerson, whose wife, Chelsi, manages the seasonal greenmarket, are featured on a segment of \"Roker on the Road,\" with Al Roker, on the Food Network. According to Ms. Rosenberg, it is welcome recognition for the restaurant as well as the neighborhood.\\n\"People are finding their way here from around New York City and beyond,\" she said. \"It\\'s what we\\'ve been working for for several years.\"\\n', 'MY friend Ashton and her boyfriend, Bob, are leaving Ashton\\'s roomy, prewar apartment on West End Avenue and buying a two-story house in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.\\nThey are not making a real estate killing, the only reason I would consider budging from the Upper West Side. Like many of my fellow middle-aged Upper West Siders, I am hanging on for dear life to my bought-cheap apartment, and I\\'d hate to leave my friends, my pediatrician and my building\\'s invaluably helpful porters, the only two men I have actually considered leaving my husband for.\\nBut making money is not Ashton and Bob\\'s purpose -- which is good, since this up-and-coming neighborhood has up and come. Though the parents of young-adult children from previous marriages, Ashton and Bob are bohemians at heart. They go dancing at clubs and have small, cryptic his-and-hers tattoos on their forearms. Ashton moved to the Upper West Side from TriBeCa to be closer to her children\\'s schools, but now that her daughter is in college and her son about to go, she sees no reason to stay.\\n\"There\\'s just more street life,\" Ashton explained, though a case could be made that the street life almost anywhere is an improvement over the street life that West End Avenue has to offer, which is to say none.\\n\"We\\'re the first stop over the Williamsburg Bridge,\" Ashton said, urging me to come and see her there. My first thought was, Do I have to? Williamsburg has always sounded far, far away, and while I felt awful about it, I was already looking for excuses for not to visit her there, wherever there was.\\nGiving Brooklyn the back of your hand is a tradition in Manhattan, long predating the objections brought on by the recent exodus, objections that seem to lay the blame on too many strollers, too many hipsters, too much bragging by new residents.\\nEntrenched Manhattanites, one of the most provincial tribes on the planet, are willfully ignorant about Brooklyn. We may not be proud of the fact; I\\'m not, anyway, though I suspect some of my friends are. \"Let me say this about that,\" said my friend Ellie, who has lived for decades on the Upper East Side, when I brought up Brooklyn. \"The thought of Brooklyn has never crossed my mind and never will.\"\\nI have been to Brooklyn a couple of dozen times over the years. I have taken my children to Coney Island to see a sword swallower, which was wonderfully terrifying, and to Brighton Beach to see the spangly Russian circus on ice (leave before the skating bears, who will break your heart), and to the Brooklyn Museum and to the public library and to Prospect Park. But I have done each of these things only once.\\nOther friends have had similarly dilettantish experiences. \"I went to Paris before I went to Brooklyn,\" admitted my friend Lucy, who has lived in Manhattan for 25 years. This seemed a little extreme, until I realized that I also went to Paris before I went to Brooklyn.\\nGetting there sounds so hard to us spoiled Manhattanites, for whom nothing is that far away, by foot or public transportation. Jesus himself could come to Brooklyn and we would whine, \"I meant to go, but I don\\'t know, it just seemed really complicated.\" Nor do we trust any Brooklyn dweller\\'s blithe, easy-as-pie directions.\\nJust as every Manhattanite has a story about the fantastic apartment that got away -- the two-bedroom on Gramercy Park we could have bought for pennies in 1984 -- we all have a horror story about one spectacularly awful trip to Brooklyn, the fiasco that we can\\'t ever seem to recover from.\\nMine was the trip to the Brooklyn Children\\'s Museum with my 6-year-old daughter, along with a friend of mine and her 3- and 6-year-old children. The museum offers weekend trolley rides from Grand Army Plaza, presumably to lure those daunted by the subway-and-walking directions you get over the phone. With our retinue, it seemed easier to take a taxi to the trolley, and we found a gypsy cab willing to take all five of us.\\nThe 3-year-old threw up shortly after we crossed the Brooklyn Bridge. The owner of a Flatbush Avenue hair salon kindly let us in so we could clean up, but it took another livery cab to get us to the trolley, which by then seemed less like a treat than an annoying attempt to distract travelers from the fact that the Children\\'s Museum was somewhere near Jakarta. The cab we finally found to take us back to Manhattan broke down on the exit ramp coming off the Brooklyn Bridge. It\\'s like that feeling when you\\'re stuck in traffic on the Long Island Expressway; fair or not, you start to hate all of Long Island.\\nThe other day, to see what was happening for myself, I spent an afternoon in Williamsburg, the cool part. I ended up flashing back to my youth: I am too old to shop at anyplace called Earwax Records, and the cloying smell of incense in the Tibetan clothing shop sent me right back outside. But the place had a hopeful sweetness; my college-age daughter would love it.\\nI SPENT another afternoon with my family strolling through Brooklyn Heights, elegant and stage-set perfect, and from there to a scrappy area along Columbia Street called the Waterfront District. We ducked out of the rain into a cozy used bookstore, where we sat and read in easy chairs until the rain stopped. We bought a toile tray and fat cupcakes at a combination bakery-curios shop. We poked our heads into a dark, Dickensian furniture shop where Deco and 50\\'s pieces were selling for a song. I browsed at a dress shop owned by local designers that featured a plate of Rice Krispies treats free for the taking. We loved every minute.\\nOur guides were my nephew, Glenn, and his girlfriend, Katie. Glenn, who moved to Brooklyn Heights from the East Village last year, is not blindly in love with Brooklyn; he misses his old all-night magazine store, and says the nearest bar/restaurant is bland in menu and atmosphere with, yes, too many couples with strollers. He longs for a nearby joint that\\'s rude and loud. But he loved Brooklyn from the moment he stepped out of the subway at Clark Street to look at apartments. \"The exquisiteness was like a thunderbolt,\" he said. \"You can go from Brooklyn Heights to Cobble Hill to Carroll Gardens, and it still looks like Henry James, block after block.\"\\nBrooklyn is his slice of heaven, and I can see why, but I already have mine.\\nTHE NEW BROOKLYNS/BACKLASH Jenny Allen is a contributing editor at Good Housekeeping and a stand-up comic.\\n', 'AT a party on the Upper West Side in 2000, a distinguished American author, and longtime Manhattanite, asked where I lived.\\n\"Brooklyn,\" I told him.\\nHe snorted. \"Poor people live in Brooklyn.\" Then he turned away to get some meat.\\nShortly after the party, to see if I could move from my rented apartment in Boerum Hill, I went looking to see what I could buy in a part of Fort Greene where cars parked on the street were still regularly stolen. I told the broker that it would be nice for my kids to have a house by a park. \"We just sold a house by the park: $510,000,\" the broker said. But there was a catch. \"It had no walls or ceilings.\"\\nWhat happened, I wondered, to the distinguished author\\'s \"poor people\"?\\nSeveral years ago before, representatives of the giant warehouse shopping club Costco had approached the City Planning Department with a question: would it be worth it to open a Costco in Sunset Park, an area of Brooklyn that had lots of the aforementioned poor people? The economic data wasn\\'t encouraging. Lots of Asian immigrants lived in the area, and their median income was not high. Also, the site was half the usual size, so the Costco store would have to be built in two stories, with costly elevators and escalators.\\nBut the city\\'s statisticians advised Costco to go ahead. There was money in those undistinguished apartment houses and wood-frame houses, they said, more money than met the eye. Being an immigrant area, the neighborhood has a thriving underground economy, they said, and official housing data doesn\\'t account for illegally subdivided units.\\nThe store opened in 1996 and turned a profit in its first year. Nine years later, according to company figures, it is among the nation\\'s highest-grossing Costcos, earning upward of $150 million this year compared with $120 million for an average Costco. In fact, the store has been so successful, the chain is considering opening another giant warehouse in Brooklyn.\\nIt has become a clich\\xc3\\xa9 to say that Brooklyn is booming. But the change has become so broad -- sweeping up the yuppies of Fort Greene, the immigrant shoppers at Costco, the hipsters of Williamsburg -- that it looks for all the world like a difference not just in degree but in kind. Long seen by that distinguished author and by so many others as a poor backwater, Brooklyn now buzzes with a momentum that would have stunned residents of its sleepy streets not long ago. The change has effects salutary (a housing boom, thriving cultural life) and perilous (soaring housing costs, displacement), but the one constant is that it is huge.\\nWith 2.5 million people, the borough is bigger than San Francisco, Boston, Atlanta and St. Louis combined. The population is approaching the historic high of 1950, when Brooklyn was home to 2.74 million souls. Turn around, and you will see the renaissance. There isn\\'t a single vacant storefront along Fulton Street in Bedford-Stuyvesant, and hordes of shoppers throng Pitkin Avenue in Brownsville. After decades of disinvestment in Brooklyn, major projects are in the works, among them the development of 175 waterfront blocks, complete with 40-story luxury apartment buildings, along the Greenpoint-Williamsburg waterfront; the construction of an 800,000-square-foot sports complex for the Nets in the Atlantic Yards; and, in Red Hook, the return of cruise ships, including the Queen Mary 2 and the Queen Elizabeth 2, to a major new pier and passenger terminal.\\nAnd while housing is exploding citywide -- the number of housing permits granted citywide last year exceeded the permits granted in all of the 1990\\'s -- the two boroughs with the most housing starts in this bustling market are Queens and Brooklyn. Why so many homes? Brooklyn\\'s prime appeal is relatively low cost. Let\\'s not kid ourselves. If rents in Manhattan fell, half the hipsters in Brooklyn would rush the bridges; they\\'re a floating population. But it can\\'t be just that; otherwise Staten Island and the Bronx would also qualify.\\nPeople are also moving to Brooklyn because -- who in the 80\\'s could ever have guessed? -- it has become so much safer. From 1990 to 2000, according to the state\\'s Division of Criminal Justice Services, car theft in the borough plunged by 75 percent, robbery by 67 percent and homicide by 69 percent. In terms of mass transit, it\\'s the best-connected borough after Manhattan, with 167 of the city\\'s 468 subway stations.\\nAS for me, I live in Park Slope because I\\'m a writer. It\\'s in my union contract. Brooklyn has become the Iowa City of the East, an area chronicled and cataloged and celebrated in countless novels and poems, read and unread. The number of Brooklynites who identified themselves as \"authors and writers\" to the Census Bureau more than doubled to 3,111 in 2000 from 1,506 in 1990. By contrast, the number of \"cabinetmakers and bench carpenters\" dipped almost by half over the same period, to 334 from 602.\\nBecause of all the creative types who call the borough home, the new Brooklyn is hip. One of the clearest signs of this was a 2002 cover article in Time Out New York that ran under the headline \"Manhattan -- The New Brooklyn\" and tried hard to make the case that Manhattan was cool again. \"The Upper East Side is just a dorm,\" I overheard a young Asian hipster say to a friend as they walked amid the milling crowds on Court Street. \"I like it here. There\\'s so much life.\"\\nSometimes all of South Brooklyn feels like a giant set for a sitcom about trendy young people. On plywood barriers at a construction site on Fourth Avenue in Park Slope, I noticed a series of desperate public pleas for a change of heart by a departing roommate: \"I  3/5sheart 4/5 You Scout Please Don\\'t Leave\"; \"Scout if you stay I\\'ll be nice to you all the time. Even when I\\'m PMS\\'ing\"; \"Kate says if you stay, you can spend another night in her bed.\"\\nIt was not always thus. The unnamed young Irish hero of the Gilbert Sorrentino love story \"The Moon in Its Flight,\" set in 1948, returns to Brooklyn after a party with his sophisticated Bronx girlfriend in equally sophisticated Forest Hills. At the party, \"He skulked in his loud Brooklyn clothes,\" the novelist writes.\\n\"When he got off the train in Brooklyn an hour later, he saw his friends through the window of the all-night diner, pouring coffee into the great pit of their beer drunks. He despised them as he despised himself and the neighborhood. He fought against the thought of her so that he would not have to place her subtle finesse in these streets of vulgar hells, benedictions, and incense.\"\\nBut the new Brooklyn has more than one face. \"There are two Brooklyns,\" pointed out Arun Peter Lobo, deputy director of the population division of City Planning. \"At the very least.\" Indeed, anything you could say about Brooklyn, the fourth-largest city in America, is true somewhere within its borders. Yes, it\\'s full of hipsters; Rhode Island School of Design students hop on the bus to Williamsburg as soon as they graduate. Yes, it\\'s full of parents, marching their strollers down Union Street to shop at the organic foods co-op. Yes, it\\'s also full of immigrants.\\nAlthough Queens, the borough most thought of as the new melting pot, is home to more than a million immigrants, Brooklyn is fast catching up, with 932,000. About 38 percent of Brooklynites are foreign-born; if you include their children, their numbers jump to more than 55 percent.\\nThis isn\\'t the Jewish Brooklyn of Woody Allen or the Italian Brooklyn of \"Moonstruck.\" There are people living in Brooklyn who have no idea what stickball is, what stoop-sitting is, who the Dodgers were or why they left Brooklyn. These people play cricket in Marine Park, barbecue suckling pigs in their backyards, listen to Russian matinee idols in Brighton Beach nightclubs, and worship not Kobe Bryant and Derek Jeter but Diego Maradona, an Argentine soccer player, and Sachin Tendulkar, an Indian cricket star. They are inventing their own Brooklyn, a Brooklyn their kids will be nostalgic about 20 years from now.\\nWilly Loman, too, still lives in Brooklyn. Desperate working folks, salesmen and otherwise, struggle to provide for their families, to make the commission; attention is still not being paid. Income disparities are as big as Brooklyn itself; in 2000, the median household income in the wealthiest census tract -- in Brooklyn Heights -- was $112,414. In the poorest tract, in Coney Island, the median income, at $7,863, was not even one-tenth of that. The housing crisis exacerbates this inequality, with the world divided between those who own and those who rent.\\nAnother big division in Brooklyn is between neighborhoods close to the water, or to a park, and those away from the blue and the green. People live in the western parts of Brooklyn with their eyes fixed westward. There are people in Park Slope who can tell you where to get the best gelato in Manhattan but have no idea where to find the best roti in Brownsville. Well inland are the nonimmigrant poor, people who have been poor for a long time and aren\\'t just off the plane from somewhere else, aren\\'t hoarding hope for their children as they toil in sweatshops.\\nThe new Brooklyn has not cured poverty or solved related problems like inadequate schools. Low-quality schooling hits poor and immigrant families the most because it depletes the only substantial capital they have: their children. The children, with their great promise, are these families\\' Microsoft before Windows, their I.B.M. when it was just a typewriter company. When a public school succeeds spectacularly, like P.S. 321, in whose Park Slope district house buyers must pay a premium, parents storm the gates, with varying success. So it\\'s private school for many Brooklyn parents -- at $20,000 a year. \"It\\'s become punitive living here,\" says a writer friend who was trying to raise her kids in Park Slope. She couldn\\'t afford a house, even though her husband is a corporate lawyer. Eventually she left Brooklyn to ride horses in a mountain village in Spain, and is happier for it.\\nMOREOVER, the various redevelopment plans, grand as they are, are being fought block by block by people who will be displaced by them. The Nets arena will sit in a spot that has among the best access to mass transit in the city -- \"every train but the F,\" as my landlord proudly said when I was renting an apartment near there in 2002. Traffic, already hellish on Flatbush Avenue, may get still more hellish as several thousand fans converge at game time.\\nSo there are downsides to the new Brooklyn, but there is the boom -- and beyond all the economic data, there is a very human pull to the borough. In the world\\'s loneliest city, Brooklyn offers community. Everybody can find community in Brooklyn: the body-fluid artists in Bushwick, the Chinese restaurant workers in Sunset Park, the die-hard Marxists in the Park Slope food co-op. No matter how foreign or fringe you are, the borough has a support group for you.\\nOne reason for this is that Brooklyn is famously a series of neighborhoods. Another has to do with the physical structure of that emblem of Brooklyn -- the brownstone. Adjoining rear gardens facilitate communal interaction, gardening tips exchanged over a backyard fence. Maybe what attracts the hipsters to Brooklyn isn\\'t just cheap rents. It\\'s the closest they can get to the families they left behind, in Kansas, in Vermont, in Tokyo.\\nFor me, Brooklyn became a neighborhood one steamy August night in 2003. It was the night of the great Northeastern Blackout. In Park Slope, volunteers were out directing traffic at every intersection, even if the drivers laughed at them and zoomed past. Other Brooklynites shared phones and flashlights, or helped the elderly down dark stairwells.\\nAs night fell, the texture of the city changed. The street lamps were out, and people strolled about with flashlights and lanterns. There was a bright white moon high above the city competing with the red glory of Mars, the warrior planet, which hadn\\'t been so close to Earth in 60,000 years. The ancient Brooklyn tradition of stoop-sitting enjoyed a sudden revival.\\nAt midnight, the bars were still dispensing ice for our whiskeys. We took our drinks out on the sidewalk; we\\'d make our own laws tonight. Everyone\\'s face was illuminated in flickering, flattering light, and everybody looked beautiful and desirable. The floodlit megalopolis was transformed into a series of villages lighted by millions of small lights, in whose glow Brooklyn was revealed to be what we had forgotten it really is: an impossibly romantic, a 19th-century city.\\nTHE NEW BROOKLYNS/SIGNS OF CHANGING TIMES Suketu Mehta is the author of \"Maximum City: Bombay Lost and Found\" (Knopf).\\n', 'LIKE many New Yorkers, I groaned when the Kmart went up in Astor Place in 1996. Although I\\'ve been known to celebrate Target\\'s underwear supply, and I bought my fax machine at Best Buy, I find nothing more overwhelming than browsing in a big-box store, with its booming pop music, jaundiced fluorescent lights and mind-numbingly endless aisles of products.\\nSo I have been surprised to find myself among the many New Yorkers converging on the Container Store, at 19th Street and the Avenue of the Americas in Chelsea, not just for the shopping, but for its restorative effect. At the Container Store\\'s 25,000-square-foot beachhead, devotees wander past the 70-foot-long wall of coat hangers in shades of peach and lime, past honeycombs of diamond-shaped sock organizers and Lucite shoeboxes in every color of the rainbow, suffused with a feeling of tranquillity.\\nThe Container Store is dedicated to the proposition that there is a place for everything sprawling and untidy, and that that place is probably made of Lucite and probably stackable. It has become such a familiar part of the shopping landscape that many of us can no longer remember where we bought coat hangers and milk crates before the store opened.\\nEven those who secretly wonder just how many filing cabinets and in-boxes one person can possibly buy have been known to embrace this particular place. As if in a trance, they dreamily push their overflowing carts and smile as beatifically as Stepford wives as they make their way down aisles wide enough to accommodate the twin strollers that have become the hallmark of latter-life procreators. Track lights shine their heavenly beams on the portable canvas closets, the stacking totes, the Tupperware and the galvanized metal storage cubes, all in soothing earth tones of khaki and moss and pewter.\\n\"It\\'s all possibilities in there,\" explained Raina Moore, a 34-year-old children\\'s book editor who lives in a 425-square-foot apartment in South Williamsburg, Brooklyn, and has a particular fondness for closet organizing supplies. She often makes weekly trips to the Container Store, whether or not she needs a new rattan gift box.\\nThe place gives Ms. Moore the illusion of power, tantalizingly holding out the idea that the chaos of her life, not to mention the clutter found in the typical 500-square-foot apartment, can be brought under control. \"Everything in there is a solution,\" Ms. Moore said. \"As soon as you walk in, you just feel like your problems are solvable.\"\\nThere are thousands of tiny projects that can be finished with just a little help from these storage gurus. The moment I put the cat food in the purple plastic bucket with the spinning lid, I have achieved my goal. I\\'m relaxed just thinking about it.\\nSome Container Store disciples don\\'t even actually buy the stuff. So soothing is the place, they simply roam among its smorgasbord of items, fantasizing about the perfect compartmentalized closet, the perfectly organized spice rack.\\n\"You walk in, and you just feel this immediate sense of calm,\" says Cris Beam, a 33-year-old writer and avid Container Store browser, who lives in a 500-square foot apartment with her partner in Morningside Heights. During times of high stress, Ms. Beam has been known to frequent the Container Store several times a week; for her, even wandering the aisles empty-handed is enough to melt away the anxiety.\\nOf course, there\\'s something else going on. We New Yorkers, with our shoebox-sized apartments, our lack of garages and basements and attics, are the perfect audience for this particular chain store.\\nWhile organizational products have been available for years at Container Store competitors like Hold Everything, that store is relatively small, and caters largely to a more upscale clientele. Bed, Bath & Beyond is the opposite: filled with clutter that only compounds a sense of imminent chaos. \"You go into Bed, Bath & Beyond,\" Ms. Moore said, \"and you\\'re already having to move things around to fit that new thing that you\\'re buying.\"\\nThe Container Store, by contrast, follows a very calculated strategy. It offers just the right number of options -- enough to appeal to a variety of social classes (coat hangers range from 29 cents for the classic plastic tubular hanger to $19.99 for a cedar suit hanger), but not so many that you feel as if you\\'ve stepped into a vertical flea market. The chain has also made a conscious decision not to diversify: You won\\'t find hand lotion and gum at the cash register.\\nThe Container Store, which began in 1978 with a single outpost in Texas selling industrial storage products that had previously been available only wholesale, now has 34 outlets. The New York store, though only 18 months old, is the chain\\'s most profitable; it did $24 million worth of business last year ($9 million in shelving alone), which is three times as much as the average Container Store.\\nFull-time employees -- a group that includes everyone from college students and grandparents to aspiring actors and disillusioned lawyers -- undergo 241 hours of training in their first year, and learn to ask all sorts of probing questions about your problems so they can use the cross-training that has been drilled into them. Yes, that garbage bin could double as a laundry basket. That laundry basket could work as a dog bed. The Lucite storage bins can be used for holding winter clothes or seasoning a turkey (and customers have bought them for both purposes).\\nOne customer came in search of a way to divide her mother\\'s ashes among three sisters (a clerk presented her with four small tin paint cans and four silk-covered gift boxes in which to put them). Another woman needed a box in which she could lock up her food; she was afraid that her boyfriend was going to poison her. Even in issues truly involving life and death, the Container Store can offer at least a temporary solution.\\nURBAN TACTICS Lisa Selin Davis\\'s first novel, \"Belly,\" will be published this month by Little Brown.\\n', 'In some parts of New York, the word stroller elicits images of Bugaboo behemoths and others like them that are popular in parent-heavy neighborhoods. But on Wednesday, more than 1,500 strollers are expected to gather on Staten Island, and there will not be an infant in sight.\\nIn this case, the strollers are people over 65 who will be celebrating having walked miles and miles this summer as part of a city program to promote exercise and healthy habits among New York\\'s older population.\\nThe \"Senior Stroll,\" sponsored by the New York City Department for the Aging, will bring together 140 walking clubs from throughout the city for a mile-long stroll through Fort Wadsworth. The clubs, which come together at centers for the aging, churches and nursing homes, provide opportunities not only for a bit of a workout, but also for social interaction.\\nWith nearly one out of every five New Yorkers now over age 60, according to the department, the agency has been seeking low-cost ways to keep older residents in shape. Having encouraged the creation of walking clubs in the past, officials decided to up the ante this year and add a contest to see how far club members could collectively walk from April through August.\\nHarriet Stollman, director of the department\\'s health promotion division, calculated the number of steps necessary to cross the boroughs, with 2,000 steps equaling about a mile, and distributed pedometers to clubs. They selected their own walking path, be it on a city street, at a nearby park, or indoors to keep cool. \"Seniors want to take care of themselves and maintain their health,\" Ms. Stollman said. \"They recognize the importance of physical activity, and are willing to get out there and be as active as possible, even if they\\'re using a cane or walker.\"\\nSome groups have amassed an impressive number of steps. The one at the United Hindu Cultural Council Senior Center in South Ozone Park, Queens, has recorded more than 4.6 million steps, the highest in Queens, and an amount that Ms. Stollman says is equal to crossing the borough one way more than 180 times. At the Senior Stroll, the team with the most miles from each borough will be recognized for its effort with a certificate and a plaque.\\n\"My philosophy is that everybody should be happy and healthy,\" said Chan Jamoona, the director of the United Hindu center, as she clipped a pedometer to the waistline of Sookia Ramshoi\\'s Marshmallow Peep-yellow dress. Ms. Jamoona, who is also a nurse, ushered Ms. Ramshoi, 74, and the other 80 members of the center\\'s walking club outside, and with an authority that was half drill sergeant, half kindergarten line leader, led the walkers down Rockaway Boulevard. Walking two by two, the walkers stretched back nearly a block, laughing and singing as their neighbors waved hello.\\nThe group, most of whose members are in their 70\\'s, takes to the streets three or four times a week, usually for a few blocks. \"I have a bad knee, but since I\\'ve been coming here, I feel much better,\" said Phulbas Swebans, 75. Ms. Swebans has diabetes, but she said the walking sessions had lessened her need for blood sugar medication and lowered her blood pressure. She now takes yoga classes at the center and has been trained as an instructor. \"It\\'s for my own health and benefit,\" she said. \"You have to look after No. 1.\"\\nAnother regular walker, Jennet Khan, 71, agreed. \"When you go in for a check-up, your doctor doesn\\'t believe your age,\" she said. \"He asks for your birth certificate.\"\\nSome clubs, like the one at the Diana Jones Senior Center in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, are using the strolls to explore their neighborhoods and share their own history tours.\\n\"They see the changes in the neighborhood and all the new development,\" said Narcisa Ruiz, the program director at the Jones center. \"As we go by Broadway and Kent Avenue, or by Peter Luger\\'s, for example, they remind each other how it used to be when they were younger, and start telling you stories.\"\\nThe relationships formed within the walking groups can be just as important as the physical benefits, Ms. Stollman said.\\n\"A lot of seniors don\\'t like walking alone; they\\'re afraid,\" she said. \"But now they look out for each other. They walk with friends, enjoy the outdoors, and participate in something that keeps them young.\"\\n', '', 'BACK in 1998, Bedford Avenue had no cheery muffin store. The main drag of Williamsburg, Brooklyn, was, however, home to a growing number of galleries, plenty of illegal residential lofts and an incipient chorus of complaints over the nighttime din outside musty local bars. The dream of an edgy Williamsburg was young and alive. And when a young couple started a small wholesale bag-making business on Bedford Avenue, the effort seemed perfectly in step with broader trends in the area.\\nOn Thursday night, the business, known as Brooklyn Industries, reached a milestone of sorts. At its store on Bedford Avenue at North Eighth Street, devotees of Brooklyn Industries gathered for a retrospective to honor its artistic vision, which is now in display at six retail locations and on a thriving Web site. The Williamsburg to be seen outside the flagship store has changed; it is characterized by strollers, people in business attire and little dogs on leashes. But at least at this event, the same doses of hair dye and irony that made the area famous in recent years were in full view.\\n\"Now it\\'s a party,\" said a young woman, her short hair bleached three-fourths white and one-fourth a very strident brown, as the beat of a laconic reggae song grew louder. Along the store\\'s north wall there stood a giant display depicting a timeline of Brooklyn Industries\\' T-shirt designs through the ages.\\n\"It\\'s urban culture, sort of street wear in general,\" said Paul Cochran, a 25-year-old designer who knew of the store\\'s reputation even before he moved to Brooklyn from Cincinnati last year. Once in town, Mr. Cochran hastened to view in person the store\\'s endless assortment of bags, jeans, jackets, skirts and especially T-shirts -- everywhere T-shirts.\\nAs the party swelled, young men and women wearing serious expressions and winter hats and scarves nibbled cheese and cookies; others in dreadlocks and faux-hawks sipped white wine from plastic cups. Young children, a newer addition to the neighborhood, jumped onto camouflage-colored chairs and huddled over a Game Boy.\\nThe shirts on display, a sort of greatest-hits collection, included messages both local (\"Save the G Train,\" \"The Kings County\"); Spanish (\"Revolt Brooklyn!\"); and international (\"Cuba Libre,\" featuring an image of Castro in a threatening pose). Some newer designs were more abstract in message; one from last year depicted a tranquil-looking woman sitting on the back of a grimacing man, both of them clothed.\\nThe store\\'s co-founders, Lexy Funk and Vahap Avsar, circulated through the crowd, chatting with customers, designers and employees as the band Death From Above 1979 blared from the stereo.\\nWhen the couple first met in the late 1990\\'s at an artists\\' residence program upstate, it is unlikely that they imagined they would become the grande dame and grand homme of Williamsburg couture.\\n\"Vahap found a billboard in a Dumpster one night,\" Ms. Funk said, explaining how the business began. \"We brought it to our studio, and decided to make a billboard bag out of it. We went to the first trade show we could find and started selling them.\"\\nAt the time, the couple were living in Manhattan, but they soon occupied a factory at North 15th Street and Wythe Avenue in Williamsburg\\'s north end, and under the label Crypto started making more bags -- out of used FedEx boxes, pieces of felt, anything they could find. Some bags fell apart, but people liked them, and soon the couple were producing T-shirts with a Brooklyn Industries logo.\\nAt the time, the scene on Bedford Avenue was in its infancy. \"It was a few little cafes and a few clothing stores,\" said Matt Wood, who designed many of the T-shirts to be seen at the party. \"Now I come back here, and there\\'s stuff everywhere.\"\\nIn those spare first months and years, Mr. Avsar and Ms. Funk lived above the factory, and sold items only wholesale. But they soon decided to open their own shop in 2000, in a 300-square-foot space on Bedford Avenue. Sales grew, and after the Sept. 11 attacks, the couple decided to end their wholesale business and focus only on retailing Brooklyn Industries goods. A mini-empire was born.\\nAS the party continued, longtime customers reflected on how their neighborhood has evolved.\\n\"It\\'s turning into a mini-Village,\" complained Tatiana Ardila, 20, who grew up in Williamsburg and works at Starbucks. Her companion, Michal Dulski, also 20 and a graphic designer, looked around at the shop and remembered its past.\\n\"Originally when this store started, it was pretty plain,\" said Mr. Dulski, who was wearing a gray ski jacket, a Brooklyn Industries computer bag and a sheen of stubble. While the pressed-tin walls used to be lined with a minimalist display of shirts and bags, the racks and shelves now burst forth with an array of garments in understated yellows, browns and greens. The neighborhood, too, has expanded, so much so, Mr. Dulski predicted, that on the next shirt \"they\\'ll probably have to put in a couple of high-rises.\"\\nYet some of the T-shirts pay homage to the Williamsburg that is not new. Leonora Russo, known by many as the mayor of Williamsburg, is shown on a white T-shirt in two photos: one of her as a 19-year-old model, the other of her many decades later. Her 19-year-old self paid $25 a month in rent and was the object of so much attention on the street that she caused car crashes on Bedford Avenue.\\n\"That\\'s when the streets went both ways,\" said Ms. Russo, who this evening was wearing a brown fur coat, a sequined beret and the same tinted windshield glasses she wears on her T-shirt. She had been a shopper at the store when Mr. Wood, the designer, decided to immortalize her in cotton. Now she sees her own face -- her faces, really -- everywhere.\\nAt the party, in between telling old stories, Ms. Russo took customers by the hand over to the display and pointed to the shirt with her cane, all pride and radiance. \"You gotta buy one and sleep in it,\" she said, possibly winking. \"Pretend I\\'m in your arms.\"\\n', 'On a rainy winter afternoon, just a few minutes after running over a stray hubcap, just after having to pull his beat-up Toyota sedan off a beat-up section of the beat-up Brooklyn-Queens Expressway and having to run the little white car back and forth until at last the hubcap broke free, Tom Le, choreographer-turned-real-estate-agent, re-enters the mad rush of the highway and a mile or so later exits as planned, ending up on a detour, Park Avenue. \"I\\'m running a little late,\" he says, semicalmly, into his cellphone.\\nThis Park Avenue, by the way, is no Park Avenue. This Park Avenue runs through the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn, passing soot-covered stores, forgotten (for the moment, anyway) tenements, forlorn housing projects, factories that may or may not be empty, auto-repair shops and Hasidic women pushing strollers. This is the Park Avenue that -- as the sky now begins to pour, as the broken-up streets flood with oil-slicked water -- lands Tom Le, a Corcoran Group Realtor, at the intersection of Central and Evergreen, in a vista of plumbing-supply stores and fenced-in yards that is neither central nor green.\\nThen he parks, locks, dashes into an old storefront, so that he is suddenly the tiniest bit overdressed, a tinge too businesslike for the all-of-the-sudden hip environs. Brushing off his navy blue blazer and straightening his rain-soaked red tie, he orders a carrot-ginger soup, and a high-energy smile breaks across his face like a banner unfurling. With an accent that is part Californian, part Vietnamese, part top-selling real-estate agent, he asks rhetorically, \"Isn\\'t this great?\"\\nBy this he means Bushwick, the next new neighborhood or, more precisely, a neighborhood that is now in the sights of New York City real-estate agents and developers as the next new neighborhood. This is Bushwick as seen from the banquette at Life Caf\\xc3\\xa9 Nine 83, a cool place with mostly comfort food (meatloaf, fried chicken) and a few vegan options. There is also a new late-night menu, now that people in the neighborhood have started staying in the neighborhood on Saturday nights.\\nBefore the late-night menu, they went to the Lower East Side, for instance, where the first Life Caf\\xc3\\xa9 opened, back when that was the next neighborhood, in the 80\\'s. Or they went to Williamsburg (the next neighborhood of the mid-90\\'s), which, of course, they still do, Williamsburg only being a couple of stops away on the L train. The point is that an early stage of next-neighborhood development happens when the people who have most recently moved in begin to recreate there the place that they either wanted to be in originally or that rent increases moved them out of. It\\'s sometimes tough to distinguish, especially now when the next-neighborhood cycles seem to be picking up speed, when people are beginning to be kicked out of neighborhoods their demographic equals haven\\'t even heard about yet.\\nThough people are now hearing about Bushwick. \"The neighborhood\\'s definitely, as they call it, up and coming,\" says Roody Hyacinthe, an agent with Fillmore Real Estate who sells in Brooklyn. \"I remember two or three years ago, when houses were coming on the market, we were giving them away.\" They\\'re not giving them away anymore.\\n\"You will see,\" says Le.\\nNaturally for Tom Le, as for real-estate agents and real-estate buyers and renters everywhere, Bushwick\\'s hotness is, first of all, about location. And in New York, location starts out as having to do with subway lines -- in this case the L train. The L train is connected to Manhattan, the island from which even next neighborhoods still ultimately derive their nextness, but in the case of Bushwick, the L train is the train that connects it to past next neighborhoods -- i.e., the Lower East Side and Williamsburg. (Until very, very recently, parts of Bushwick were referred to in real-estate listings as \"East Williamsburg,\" sometimes when it is East Williamsburg, sometimes when it isn\\'t really because it\\'s really Bushwick.)\\nBushwick is roughly the shape of Vermont. Williamsburg is its neighbor to the north. On its west is Bed-Stuy, a neighborhood that, given the rising prices in Clinton Hill, the adjacent neighborhood heading farther west, toward Manhattan, is also something of a next neighborhood. (See also the Port Morris and Mott Haven neighborhoods in the Bronx.) On Bushwick\\'s eastern border is Ridgewood, in Queens -- Ridgewood, in turn, being bordered by vast plots of parklike green that, at the moment, are zoned only for the dead.\\nAfter location in the real-estate hotness calculus comes price, and in Bushwick the price is right -- i.e., low, or pretty low, as far as New York goes. Rents, which are rising, are around $1,400 for 1,200 square feet, at the moment -- about half what they are in Dumbo, which was a next neighborhood six or seven years ago, and perhaps at a third of what they are on the Lower East Side. Likewise, a half-million dollars won\\'t get your phone call returned by real-estate agents in Manhattan, where the average apartment now sells for more than a million. But in Bushwick, half a million dollars can still get you a small single-family home (or could have before this article appeared). As Le says, continuing his lunch-table neighborhood tour, \"This hasn\\'t yet been discovered.\" And by this he still means Bushwick.\\nAs with exploration in the Renaissance, discovered in New York real estate is a problematic concept. The old building directly across the street from Life Caf\\xc3\\xa9 is owned by the Baierlein family, whose ancestors have been there since around the time Mayor McClellan was elected mayor in 1903, since the first subways opened, since the Williamsburg Bridge was built and since O. Henry wrote his New York stories. The Baierleins are a remnant of the German population that came to the little village of Bushwick in the mid-1800\\'s, the immigrant group that built the breweries of Brooklyn. In the 1920\\'s, after the Germans discovered Bushwick, it was discovered by Italians. After World War II, when the Italians moved to the suburbs, Bushwick was discovered by Puerto Ricans. During the city\\'s fiscal crisis, the last German breweries closed, and then riots during the blackout of 1977 nearly destroyed the neighborhood completely; by then, the Baierleins had boarded up their apartments to protect them from the fires that were raging through what was becoming a neighborhood of abandoned lots. Bushwick was discovered yet again in the 1980\\'s by new New Yorkers from the Dominican Republic, as well as Guyana, Ecuador, Jamaica, India and China, new immigrants who moved to Bushwick not for cool restaurants but to survive in what was a civic wasteland. Most recently, in the 10 years before the opening of the Life Caf\\xc3\\xa9 in 2002, Bushwick was discovered by people moving to New York from Mexico. Bushwick is a Dutch word sometimes translated as \"refuge.\"\\nLe\\'s discovery of Bushwick started when his own friends -- dancers and artists -- moved into lofts in the area in the 90\\'s, lofts with no heat or water or plumbing; they used charcoal barbecues to keep warm. It was then that Le was making the transition from dance to real estate, the business of his family in California. He started with Fillmore Real Estate and became a \"top producer,\" to use the industry term. \"I told them to open an office in Williamsburg,\" he goes on. \"So when we did, people started coming into the office looking for places. They\\'d say my budget, for example, is $500,000. Sadly, with half a million they can\\'t afford Williamsburg or East Williamsburg.\" And there, by East Williamsburg, he means East Williamsburg. That\\'s when he mentions the discovery: Bushwick. Real estate is so often the business of readjusting dreams.\\nTake the couple that showed up not long ago at his office. \"We were looking for Williamsburg,\" Le says, speaking real-estate-ese, a first-person plural. \"We had $700,000 to spend. One is a sculptor; the other one is also an artist, does installation. And they said, \\'We\\'d love something we could have our studio in,\\' and I said: \\'Well, 700 is a lot of money. We can get you a two-family. But for a studio, if you want bigger space, you may have to go farther out.\\' And they said: \\'Fine. What do you think you have?\\' At that time, I had a four-family and a store, plus a warehouse in the back. This is just about a year ago. In the back is a huge warehouse with a 20-foot ceiling. They went there, and their mouths -- they just went like: \\'Oh, my God! This is great!\\' And they got it for $650,000! It\\'s off of Central.\"\\nThe final factor in next-neighborhood hotness has to do with the presence of what might be broadly categorized as artists. In forest succession, leafy hardwoods like alder precede the towering softwoods like pine, and in real estate in New York, it is the artists who arrive first in a neighborhood that is about to change, especially in industrial sites, especially in large old spaces abandoned and left for dead. \"This is the story of real estate,\" Le says, \"that the artists are always pioneering.\" It is the story of SoHo, West Chelsea, Williamsburg. In this case, the first artists arrived in Bushwick in the 90\\'s, when Bushwick\\'s factory areas were still burning.\\n\"When I moved in 1991, there was a crack-for-sex trade on my landing,\" says John Jasperse. Now Jasperse is a nationally recognized choreographer who until recently kept his studio for his dance company in Bushwick; then, he was a not yet nationally recognized young choreographer who, with three other artists, persuaded a landlord to let them renovate an abandoned loft building. \"Basically the reason we were there was because nobody wanted to be there,\" he says.\\n\"It was a war zone,\" says Rob Herschenfeld, a furniture designer, who in 1996 was feeling pushed out of a rented space in Williamsburg. He bought a loft building on Boerum Street, a place that real-estate agents called East Williamsburg a few months ago (and may even be East Williamsburg) but is now called Bushwick. He did not seek out cafes at the time, not that there were any. \"We were too busy emptying out the crack addicts,\" he says.\\nTorben Giehler, a painter, showed up at the end of the 90\\'s, renting a space in Herschenfeld\\'s building; Herschenfeld\\'s mother and building manager, Phyllis, approved a lease when few other people would. \"I couldn\\'t get any credit, and Phyllis, she just liked my work and gave me the place,\" he says. He had a view of feral dogs, prostitutes and a guy who shot up heroin while driving and, as a result, ran into a couple of cars.\\nGiehler\\'s friend Jeffrey Reed, a sculptor and photographer, was there a year or two later in 2,000 square feet of raw space on the side of a construction yard, which he got for $1,200 a month. He found the streets nerve-racking. \"If you saw someone, you would start walking the other way,\" he says. \"You just assumed there wasn\\'t any reason that anyone would be there.\" When Reed visited Giehler\\'s space at the end of the day, they would look out the window at the view of burning cars. Once, as a long stream of gasoline made its way down the street, they suddenly realized that Reed\\'s car was about to catch fire, but they managed to run down and move it in time.\\nAfter artists came students, also as per the next-neighborhood cycle -- students like Cynthia Rojas, who moved in 2001, arriving from California, with her husband, Brian Lease, a classically trained vibraphone player who plays in a band called Fisherman\\'s Xylophonic Burlesque Orchestra. For recreation, they went to the Laundromat on Flushing Avenue. \"That was it,\" she says. \"It was like camping.\"\\nThe development of cool places kicked off in 2002, after Kathy Kirkpatrick, who founded the original Life Caf\\xc3\\xa9 in the 80\\'s, moved to Bushwick, taking the first apartment she saw for rent. \"Then I looked out my window,\" she says, \"and I kept seeing hipsters. And then I thought, This looks just like the people who were living in the East Village.\" In August 2002, she opened up a restaurant, small, with just a steam table, as well as newspapers and essentials, like onions and toilet paper. \"I didn\\'t realize the desperate desire of the community here to have a place -- the musicians and artists and the writers who needed to get out and hang,\" she says.\\nA few months later, Kevin Lindamood, who had come to Bushwick a few years earlier from western Virginia, renovated an industrial building and opened a nonprofit arts-oriented space called OfficeOps. There\\'s a movie screening room and a big kitchen for parties, as well as a new thrift shop. Sometimes Lindamood rents out the roof for weddings and other events. Sometimes those events are even attended by Williamsburgers.\\nAt the end of 2002, Herschenfeld built a small grocery store, Brooklyn\\'s Natural, right near the Morgan Avenue L stop exit on Bogart Street, and one of the people working with him opened a bar around the corner, called Kings County. (Today, a rock-climbing wall decorates the spire of Herschenfeld\\'s remodeled warehouse.)\\nSince Life Caf\\xc3\\xa9 and Brooklyn\\'s Natural opened, all kinds of artists and performers have come to make Bushwick home. In 2003, Jonah Bokaer, a dancer with Merce Cunningham, started Chez Bushwick, a salon for artists and performers in Herschenfeld\\'s loft building on Boerum. \"It\\'s a very catalytic place,\" Bokaer says.\\nFor his part, L.D. Beghtol says a kind of artistic critical mass may have been reached that year. Beghtol had been living in the Baierlein family\\'s apartments since 2000, moving there after five years in downtown Manhattan. A Village Voice art director, he is also a member of several bands and band collectives, like L.D. & the New Criticism, and sang on the Magnetic Fields\\' three-CD song cycle, \"69 Love Songs.\" One night in 2002, Beghtol was in Life Caf\\xc3\\xa9, having a drink, when a D.J. played the song \"Lions\" by Tones on Tail, what might be called a next-next-neighborhood band. \"I thought, I can\\'t believe I\\'m hearing this in my neighborhood bar,\" Beghtol said. The D.J. turned out to be the girlfriend of Jim Bentley, who had just moved to Bushwick from Chicago (seeing a likeness to the Ukranian Village in Chicago, where all the musicians hang out). Bentley runs the Fort, a neighborhood recording studio, and now labels the projects he produces with Beghtol and others with the stamp \"Made in Bushwick.\" \"There\\'s a lot going on here that hasn\\'t hit the airwaves, but it will,\" Beghtol says.\\nNext-neighborhood development has now reached a pivotal juncture in Bushwick. The area still won\\'t be mistaken for the Upper West Side or even Williamsburg. There is no giant luxury supermarket; there are no dry cleaners in the warehouse district, and not many anyplace else. Crime is still bad, or really bad (the rates of violent crime are still among the highest in the city) -- last year, the local precinct reported 15 murders, 40 rapes, 467 robberies and 399 felonious assaults. And while there may not be as many cars burning in the warehouse district as there used to be, the streets still feel desolate.\\nBut Bushwick is now definitely in the next stage. In May 2004, the neighborhood got its first video store-cafe, the Archive. Northeast Kingdom, the latest artist-affiliated restaurant, opened in October 2005, started by two Vermont natives currently living in Williamsburg proper. In the past year, luxury condos started showing up for $400,000. And there is even a festival -- a festival that uses an acronym, acronyms seeming to be the linchpin of the real-estate business. Late last summer, Ruth Garon, who coordinates arts events, arrived in Bushwick for the very first time, after moving from Tel Aviv to Manhattan. \"I was having a crisis with New York,\" she says. \"And it was the first time I felt a sort of community.\" Four months later, she was inspired to organize the Bushwick Art Project, or BAP, a neighborhood happening of video V.J.\\'s and D.J.\\'s and film and dance and live music. Each time Garon held a meeting in her Cook Street loft, she noticed that more and more artists came. She also noticed that local residents began to resist an art festival. \"Some people were suspicious, and they said the people from Manhattan will come and everything will be expensive,\" she recalls. \"But after a while, they saw that we were working from a pure place.\"\\nPerhaps those most affected by a neighborhood\\'s nextness are the people who are already living there, the people who have been living there for years and are not necessarily looking for a place to install a video-dance piece but are trying to live, maybe even raise children. In this case, these are the people living in what a real-estate agent might at this moment be calling Deep Bushwick, that place with tired but well-swept row houses along Knickerbocker Avenue or in and around Wyckoff Avenue, another old commercial strip. If you follow Tom Le as he tours around Bushwick in his car, he will stop you on a street of two-family row houses and get out and point around and say how great they are, as investment opportunities. \"One of the most wonderful things about Bushwick is that it is a wonderful established family neighborhood,\" he says. \"You can drive up and down the streets in Bushwick and you see families out there.\"\\nThis neighborhood of families survives on some of the lowest incomes in the city; Bushwick\\'s median household income is about $22,000. One-fifth of the neighborhood is on public assistance. Bushwick also has foreclosure rates four times higher than the city average. Meanwhile, almost 40 percent of the neighborhood pay more than 60 percent of their incomes on housing, according to a report by the Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy at New York University. A neighborhood survey found that 69 percent live with cockroaches, 47 percent with rats or mice, 30 percent with mold; the rate of hospital visits for asthma is four times the city average. Sometimes -- for people who are not on public assistance and live in a city where the highest-earning families have nine times the income of the lowest -- the rising rents are pushing tenants to buy homes they can\\'t afford.\\nAngel Vera has lived in Bushwick for 14 years. Originally from Ecuador, he is an organizer with a community group called Make the Road by Walking, on Grove Street, near the intersection of Myrtle and Broadway -- an area that was nearly destroyed during the rioting and looting of the citywide blackout in 1977. Last year, Make the Road organized the workers at discount-sneaker and apparel stores to get them the minimum wage and benefits. Still, the neighborhood feels on the verge: a little Latin American music store is closed, and the local credit union almost got priced out of an affordable office. Construction workers carry new Sheetrock into recently emptied apartments. \"There are a lot of landlords who are evicting whole buildings lately,\" Vera says. \"People move here because somewhere else is more expensive. That\\'s the system. This automatically puts low-income people in danger.\"\\nBut it\\'s not just the low-income people. Maybe it\\'s because the next-neighborhood cycle turns so quickly now or maybe it was always the case, but in the Bushwick that is about to happen, artists are already being kicked out, before more than even a handful of new home buyers get to live alongside them. \"It begs the question, Is New York just going to consume itself?\" says John Jasperse, who was kicked out of his loft space last year when his landlord began to convert his studio space into condos. \"Because the identity of it as a place of cultural expression seems less and less possible. I\\'ve really seen the ecology of the place change. And, yes, it\\'s safer and it\\'s cleaner, and, yeah, there are some individual artists who are really fighting the fight. But they\\'re also getting slammed, and you can\\'t expect that the fight is going to constantly repeat itself. It\\'s going to take some kind of responsible developer or some action by the government, because we can\\'t just be making money, money, money. If it\\'s just left to market economics, then everywhere is just going to be brokers on Wall Street.\"\\nBack at lunch, Tom Le works to keep things positive. \"There\\'s that horrible word, gentrification, but it\\'s not all bad,\" he says. And he talks about his own plan to assuage the harshness of the market, which is mostly a plan for assuaging the hardships on artists. He dreams of helping artists invest in real estate, of opening an artists\\' studio in Bushwick himself, with an upstate affiliate perhaps. He speaks of the trends in terms of unstoppable natural forces. \"The machine keeps going,\" he says, \"and it\\'s not the developers, it\\'s not the Realtors. It\\'s the demand that keeps the machine going, and you have to invest so that you are ready when the next transformation occurs. We can ride the wave or get kicked out.\"\\nBut mostly Le talks about how things are really happening in the neighborhood, pricewise. On the weekend, he will run an ad: \"Vacant 6-family in Bushwick, brownstone 26 x 70, 1 block from train and shopping in the next hot neighborhood, ideal development or condo conversion. $849K.\"\\n\"Three or six people can come in there, renovate it and have a wonderful community there,\" he says. \"It\\'s on Bushwick, right off Broadway, which is great.\"\\nEven in the past few weeks, housing prices in the neighborhood have increased. Buildings are even flipping. Le sold a building on Chauncey Street, off beat-up Bushwick Avenue, for $500,000, which the owner bought for just over $300,000 a year or so ago. And then there are the condo conversions -- a 16-unit condo conversion off Central Avenue, a few subway stops from Williamsburg and just a few minutes from Manhattan, with private parking and outdoor space at $400 a square foot -- a real deal, even if prospective buyers might be a little nervous when they first see it, at least until they see the video store and the place to buy organic yogurt.\\nAfter he finished his soup, Le set off to see a client. But he e-mailed later to check in, because since he left dance, real estate is, as he says, \"my life seven days a week.\"\\n\"As you can see, Bushwick is very dynamic,\" he wrote. \"Should you need any more assistance or you are ever in need to chat about exciting new neighborhoods or to discuss new places to hang out, please don\\'t hesitate to give me a shout.\"\\nThe Next Neighborhood Robert Sullivan is the author of \"Rats: Observations on the History and Habitat of the City\\'s Most Unwanted Inhabitants\" and \"How Not to Get Rich: Why Being Bad Off Isn\\'t So Bad.\"\\n', '', 'Explosions boomed through a quiet area of Downtown Brooklyn yesterday afternoon after propane tanks ignited during roof work atop a police precinct house, sending the metal tubes sailing like missiles into the streets below, the police said.\\nNo one was injured in the explosions or the brief but spectacular fire that followed. A thick column of ink-black smoke stopped Sunday strollers on the sidewalks. Those closest to the precinct house ran into a McDonald\\'s restaurant at Tillary and Gold Streets.\\nMykel Foreman, 12, who lives nearby, saw and heard the blast. His mother was on the telephone with a 911 operator when the second explosion occurred, he said. His own first fears were dark: \"I thought it was like the terrorists had attacked again, like it was a bomb.\"\\nThe explosions occurred at 3:11 p.m. above the 84th Precinct station, which shares the building at 301 Gold Street with the firehouse for Ladder 110 and Engine 207. Firefighters and police officers evacuated the building, and the fire brought a two-alarm response of more than 100 firefighters. The blaze was quickly extinguished, and a breeze soon cleared away the smoke.  The fire was brought under control at 3:48 p.m., the Fire Department said.\\nThe roofers spoke with fire investigators and police officials outside the building. The workers\\' clothes were darkened with grime and soot, but they otherwise appeared unharmed.\\nFive workers with a company called SCA Asbestos Removal were tarring the roof when the tanks exploded, the police said. Two tanks sailed onto Prince Street, one of them landing on the off-ramp of the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway, large enough to have done great damage to a person or vehicle, but landing on the pavement without injuring anyone. One tank landed on Tillary, a busy thoroughfare any day of the week, but quietest on Sunday.\\nSurrounding blocks and the expressway exit remained closed for hours yesterday afternoon.\\nParamedics leaned on their empty stretchers. Department of Environmental Protection and Department of Buildings officials were inspecting the building yesterday afternoon for asbestos and structural damage before allowing anyone back inside, the police said. Later, the Department of Buildings deemed the buildings \"uncompromised.\"\\nEnvironmental tests for asbestos were pending yesterday evening, said Charles Sturcken, an Environmental Protection Department spokesman.\\nTwo members of the Shomrim community watch patrol, a Hasidic group in Williamsburg, saw the explosion from their window. \"It was very, very powerful, the flames,\" said one of the men, who gave his name as Jacob. \"There was a loud explosion, a ball of fire coming up.\"\\n', 'ON almost any given Sunday, the trumpeter John McNeil walks out of his apartment and down a few tree-lined blocks to Night and Day, a bistro on Fifth Avenue in Park Slope. Since February, Mr. McNeil has held a weekly gig in a rear annex of the restaurant with a quartet he formed with the tenor saxophonist Bill McHenry. A hangout for neighborhood residents and a magnet for musicians, the engagement has become a fixture of Brooklyn\\'s rich and booming jazz scene.\\nThe rise of that scene \\xe2\\x80\\x94 which, like its borough, is an assemblage of enclaves \\xe2\\x80\\x94 has been one of the most significant developments for jazz in New York in recent years. (Every bit as significant as the Brooklyn rock explosion of a few years ago, with which it shouldn\\'t be confused.) Through a growing network of low-rent spaces mostly booked by enterprising musicians, Brooklyn has assumed a vital role in the city\\'s larger jazz culture. And the music has been a boon for listeners of all kinds, including those who have to cross the East River to hear it.\\nTo his great delight, Mr. McNeil barely has to cross the street. \"I\\'ve lived here since the early 1970\\'s,\" he said one Sunday, between sets at Night and Day. For a long time he was one of many Brooklyn jazz citizens who had to travel to Manhattan for staples of employment and entertainment. Many musicians still make that commute, occasionally to perform at marquee clubs like the Blue Note and the Village Vanguard, but more often to hold court in small rooms like the 55 Bar, Fat Cat and the Cornelia Street Caf\\xc3\\xa9, which is owned by Robin Hirsch, one of two partners behind Night and Day.\\nIn a sense Brooklyn\\'s jazz clubs operate on the same plane as those West Village bars. (It\\'s not uncommon for a group to play one night at the 55 Bar and the next at a spot in Brooklyn.) The difference between the two scenes, in terms of audience, is outlined succinctly by Mr. Hirsch, based on firsthand expertise: \"The Village will draw an international crowd, while Park Slope is strictly local.\"\\nCertainly the crowd is overwhelmingly local at Tea Lounge on Union Street in Park Slope. Walk into the cavernous coffeehouse on a Thursday or Friday night, and you\\'ll probably spot a few strollers nestled among the couches, along with laptop computers and stylish casual attire. You\\'ll also see adventurous young jazz musicians playing for tips, since Tea Lounge doesn\\'t have a cover charge.\\nThat policy attracts an audience more random and robust than the musicians might otherwise hope to reach, especially in Manhattan. This winter the alto saxophonist Andrew D\\'Angelo played one show to more than 100 people, a large crowd for an avant-garde jazz show. Some of the listeners  paid a suggested donation; others merely paid attention. Oren Arnon, who books the room, recently pegged its vibe: \"a combination of quality jazz and something social, which doesn\\'t happen often enough in this city.\"\\nA similar ethos prevails at Barb\\xc3\\xa8s, universally acknowledged as the vanguard (Village Vanguard, even) of the new Brooklyn jazz  scene. \"We tried to build a no-pressure environment for audiences and musicians,\" said Olivier Conan, who owns the bar with a fellow French expatriate and musician, Vincent Douglas. The club\\'s success confirms the wisdom of that premise.\\nBarb\\xc3\\xa8s may be the place most responsible for the perception of a Brooklyn jazz renaissance. Its cozy dimensions suit small audiences and rapt attention. And its booking describes a rough bouquet of sounds: from French musette to Brazilian forr\\xc3\\xb3, as well as  multiple strains of jazz, from Gypsy swing to collective free improvisation.\\nLong-term residencies, hardly a staple in Manhattan, are a prominent feature of the programming at Barb\\xc3\\xa8s. The violinist Jenny Scheinman usually plays on Tuesday nights, seasoning her music with flecks of jazz, classical and rustic folk. Wednesdays are devoted to an avant-garde series organized by the saxophonist Micha\\xc3\\xabl Attias. (He isn\\'t the only musician maintaining a series in the area; six blocks south, the keyboardist James Carney books Sunday nights at Bar 4, a red-lighted dive.)\\nLast month the clarinetist and saxophonist Chris Speed started Skirl, an independent record label with the express purpose of documenting some of the experimental artists in the regular Barb\\xc3\\xa8s orbit. The label\\'s next release party is scheduled for Thursday at the club.\\nExperimentation and eclecticism are hardly limited to Park Slope. In Williamsburg they converge at Rose Live Music, a stylish lounge on Grand Street that opened just a few months ago. They come together even more explicitly during the Williamsburg Jazz Festival, which will have its fourth season in September.\\nBut nothing beats the neighborhood\\'s leading spot, Zebulon Caf\\xc3\\xa9 Concert, which combines the flea-market chic of Barb\\xc3\\xa8s (the owners, Guillaume Blestel and Jef and Jocelyn Soubiran, are French) with the no-cover rule of Tea Lounge (but with one significant distinction: every artist receives a guarantee). Zebulon\\'s programming has lately leaned markedly toward world music, but the free-jazz violinist Billy Bang has made notable appearances, as has the composer and conductor Butch Morris.\\nMr. Morris also helped inaugurate a more extreme outpost, the nonprofit Issue Project Room, when it relocated last June from the East Village into a silo on the Gowanus Canal. \"The industrial environment tends to inspire a rugged sort of experimentation,\" said Suzanne Fiol, the organization\\'s director, hours before a recent premiere by the Japanese composer Shoko Nagai.\\nRugged experimentation of a different sort was one hallmark of the jazz scene in Brooklyn during its original heyday, from the late 1950\\'s through the 60\\'s. Throughout those years a cluster of African-American establishments thrived around Fulton Street and Nostrand Avenue.\\nOne of them, the Blue Coronet, served as a laboratory for youngbloods like the tenor saxophonist Wayne Shorter and the trumpeter Freddie Hubbard. Another was immortalized by Mr. Hubbard with a 1965 Blue Note album called \"The Night of the Cookers: Live at Club La Marchal,\" on which he locked horns with Lee Morgan in a casual but heated exchange.\\n\"Going back to 1960, there was something loosely called a Brooklyn sound,\" said Robert Myers, referring in part to that album. \"And it started with the venues, which gave the musicians license to explore new avenues onstage and not be confined by management.\" Until the close of 2004 Mr. Myers operated Up Over Jazz Caf\\xc3\\xa9, a bar on Flatbush Avenue that fulfilled a similar function for the latest generation of post-bop strivers, like the tenor saxophonist Marcus Strickland and the pianist Robert Glasper.\\nMr. Glasper provides an illustrative example of the current Brooklyn-Manhattan jazz symbiosis. He arrived in the city at the tail end of the 1990\\'s, settling in Brooklyn but matriculating at the New School University in Manhattan. He quickly plugged into a circuit of jam sessions stretching from Freddy\\'s Backroom, on Dean Street in Park Slope, to Smalls, a crucible of young talent in Greenwich Village.\\nAt Up Over Jazz he found steady work and a space to hone his craft. But after he earned the imprimatur of a Blue Note Records contract, his next career move was clear: a week at the Village Vanguard. (He concludes his second engagement there this weekend with his trio.)\\nMr. Glasper\\'s example also illustrates the existence of a parallel Brooklyn jazz movement among African-Americans in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Fort Greene and Clinton Hill. Self-consciously styled as a revival of Brooklyn\\'s golden era, this scene includes institutions like Jazz 966, a series held for the last 16 years at the Fort Greene Senior Citizens Council; 651 Arts, a nonprofit concert presenting organization; and the Concord Baptist Church, which holds occasional jazz services. In April a consortium of these and other groups mounted the seventh annual Central Brooklyn Jazz Festival, with \"Jazz: A Music of the Spirit\" as its theme.\\nThe author of that theme, the trumpeter  Ahmed Abdullah, was a visible presence during the festival, especially at Sista\\'s Place, a communally owned coffeehouse and salon in Bedford-Stuyvesant. \"African-Americans have rarely owned the music\\'s means of production,\" he said in a phone conversation. \"The music has to be in our community if it\\'s going to grow. We\\'ve got to have an alternative to mainstream institutions.\"\\nThe crowd that packed Sista\\'s Place one rainy Saturday for a festival performance by the trumpeter Charles Tolliver made it look as if Mr. Abdullah\\'s objective was being fulfilled. Less expectedly, his words seemed nearly as pertinent to a performance held on the same night at the Center for Improvisational Music, or CIM, a nonprofit educational effort run by the trumpeter Ralph Alessi near the northern stretch of the Gowanus Canal.\\nIt featured the alto saxophonist Tim Berne, one of the early homesteaders of the newly ascendant Brooklyn jazz community. Mr. Berne long ago claimed ownership of his music\\'s means of production with a self-sustaining record label based in a brownstone near Flatbush Avenue. And he has spent most of his career on the alternative fringe of jazz culture, though his audience at CIM included a couple of industry veterans like Jeff Levenson, who has a working affiliation with the Blue Note, one of New York\\'s most obvious mainstream jazz institutions.\\n\"Brooklyn is essentially an incubator, where a lot of things get messed with and hybridized,\" Mr. Levenson said later, speaking as an almost 30-year resident of the borough. \"I think an audience approaches that experience differently than the audience that comes to the Blue Note. There\\'s a different agenda, a different motivation. We\\'re talking works in progress, which moderates the expectation levels.\"\\nA good many Brooklyn musicians would agree with that characterization, which casts the borough\\'s jazz scene almost in the role of a loose-and-limber Triple-A  baseball team. (Higher in the pecking order than the Class A Brooklyn Cyclones, anyway.) But the idea probably wouldn\\'t sit well with Mr. Abdullah, who sees community-based creative action as a goal in itself.\\nNor for different reasons would it agree with the percussionist Matt Moran, who leads Slavic Soul Party, an improviser-stocked Balkan brass band that performs on Tuesdays at Barb\\xc3\\xa8s, after Ms. Scheinman. \"Maybe this started out as a place where people workshop things,\" Mr. Moran said outside the club recently, between sets. \"But it\\'s on the radar now, and you need to step up and present your work in the best possible light.\"\\n\"It has really arrived as a scene,\" he continued, gathering steam. \"People are saying, \\'I\\'m not going to step into the shininess of Manhattan, I\\'m going to do it in my own earthy way.\\' And rather than struggling in obscurity, they\\'re finding that now it\\'s a celebrated thing.\"\\n', 'MIGUEL HERN\\xc3\\x81NDEZ of Ossining is the only Hispanic mayor in  New York State, though  that distinction took effect early this month and will last only until year\\'s end.\\nStill, what a statement those seven months will be about how polychrome Cheever country has become. Most Americans still think of Westchester as white, and white bread, except when an urban anomaly like Yonkers conquers that stereotype. But the county, like the country, turns out to have lots of everything, even in its villages. In Ossining, Port Chester, and Sleepy Hollow, Hispanics are a major force.\\n\"I don\\'t want to make a big deal of it \\xe2\\x80\\x94 it\\'s only a part-time job,\" the unassuming Mr. Hern\\xc3\\xa1ndez said of the unassuming $12,000-a-year position. \"But it sends a message that the Hispanic community is maturing and moving into the mainstream.\"\\nThe county has one Hispanic legislator, Jos\\xc3\\xa9 I. Alvarado of Yonkers, and a tier of Hispanic movers and shakers like Felix Sanchez, a lawyer in Yonkers; Gilbert Torres, a financial adviser in White Plains; and Maria Perez, who runs an advertising firm in Elmsford. Westchesterites are glad that they can table-hop among Hispanic cuisines in Port Chester, but they are becoming aware that Hispanic merchants now run lots of shops on whiter village main streets.\\n\"They\\'re the new mom and pop,\" said Brian Nickerson, director of  Pace University\\'s Michaelian Institute for Public Policy and Management in White Plains.\\nIn that mix, Mr. Hern\\xc3\\xa1ndez turns out to be not just another ethnic pol, but an erudite 67-year-old published military historian who drives a Mini Cooper and is a connoisseur of the Croton Aqueduct and Ossining itself. Bet you didn\\'t know this village was first named Sing Sing but changed its name to distance itself from the Big House up the River.\\nMr. Hern\\xc3\\xa1ndez, a stocky, mustached man with leonine patches of white hair, reminds you he is mayor, not acting mayor. A Democrat, he was chosen from among four village trustees after the elected mayor resigned, and he will have to surrender his job at the end of the year because his party chose another candidate to run for the next two-year term.\\nAs a trustee since 2000, he helped arrange a pickup point for day laborers near the community center. But in the short time he has left, he wants to be mayor for all of Ossining\\'s 24,000 people, not just its 7,000 Hispanics. Like many migrants, he has  moved beyond his roots, in his case the coffee-lush mountains of Puerto Rico and the mean streets of East Williamsburg, in Brooklyn, where his mother, a factory worker, died when he was 15 and his father, a pipe fitter, when he was 21.\\nHe wants to spruce up Main Street\\'s fraying gingerbread facades, complete a seven-story apartment building on a once ramshackle waterfront, and build a river walk to let strollers \\xe2\\x80\\x94 not just prison guards \\xe2\\x80\\x94 soak in the Hudson River views. He wants to call attention to an Ossining gem, the gabled cottage once owned by Clement Clarke Moore, who is credited with the children\\'s poem that begins \" \\'Twas the night before Christmas.\"\\n\"People think Ossining is gritty and urban, and it certainly has that aspect to it, but then there\\'s a neighborhood like this,\" Mayor Hern\\xc3\\xa1ndez said.\\nHe wants to open two museums, one that capitalizes on Sing Sing and another centered on immigration.\\n\"We need some place where people can say, \\'My ancestors came here and built this community, and here is the proof,\\' \" he said.\\nSome Hispanic migrants settled in small villages like Ossining because they grew up in Caribbean or Latin American villages. Others wanted backyards and good schools, like Mr. Hern\\xc3\\xa1ndez, who left Brooklyn in 1981 for an $86,000 house (though he still sprinkles his conversation with New York Yiddishisms, as in \"I\\'ll show you the whole megillah\"). Just because Ossining had many Hispanics did not mean he would have much in common with all of them, he likes to emphasize.\\n\"We are different tribes,\" he said. \"The analogy I make is with the Brits. We\\'re divided by a common tongue.\"\\nMr. Hern\\xc3\\xa1ndez knows about divisions. He worked as a Justice Department mediator in the 71-day standoff between Indians and federal authorities in 1973 at Wounded Knee, S.D. Later, as the executive director of New York City\\'s Human Rights Commission, he negotiated a public-housing settlement between Hasidim and Puerto Ricans in Williamsburg.\\nWhen he looks at the engineering marvel of the aqueduct, he recalls that it was built by Irishmen who set up camps in places that are now Sleepy Hollow and Ossining and came to dominate those municipalities. The Irish of Ossining have prospered and are less drawn to politics. But there\\'s a new force of laborers \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and professionals like Mr. Hern\\xc3\\xa1ndez \\xe2\\x80\\x94 waiting in the wings.\\n', '', 'KIRYAS JOEL, N.Y., Aug. 22 \\xe2\\x80\\x94 As the administrator of this village in southern Orange County, Gedalye Szegedin knows that much of his job revolves around a simple equation: the number of girls who get married is roughly equal to the number of new homes this community will need to accommodate its rapid growth.\\nLast year, Mr. Szegedin oversaw the construction of 200 houses and apartments, mostly on the outer-lying lots along the eastern edge of this 1.1-square-mile community, an ultra-Orthodox Jewish enclave about 60 miles north of Midtown Manhattan. By the end of this year, he said, the village will most likely have 300 new homes.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere are three religious tenets that drive our growth: our women don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t use birth control, they get married young and after they get married, they stay in Kiryas Joel and start a family,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Szegedin said.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOur growth comes simply from the fact that our families have a lot of babies,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he added, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand we need to build homes to respond to the needs of our community.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nBut developable land is a finite resource here, and not much of it is left. And as Kiryas Joel pushes up against its borders, nearby neighbors in the towns of Blooming Grove and Woodbury are moving aggressively to prevent the community from expanding by incorporating into villages of their own.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe still have huge tracts of open land in Woodbury, and we want to keep it that way,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Woodbury\\xe2\\x80\\x99s supervisor, John P. Burke, who grew up in the Bronx and moved to Orange County in 1969.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe want to make sure that no outside community is able to completely transform the character and the look of our town,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf we need a village to do that, so be it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nKiryas Joel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s population leaped to 18,300 last year from 13,100 in 2000 and 7,400 in 1990, making it one of the fastest growing places in the state, according to the most recent estimates by the Census Bureau. For two years, developers and local officials have been searching for private parcels in surrounding communities, hoping to expand the village through annexation for the third time since it was incorporated in 1977 as an offshoot of the Satmar Hasidic sect of Williamsburg, Brooklyn.\\nAfter its incorporation, most of the growth was driven by migration from New York City. But now, new arrivals are mostly babies and grooms coming to marry one of the local women.\\nWorried residents in Blooming Grove, which lies northwest of here, and Woodbury, which lies east,  have voted overwhelmingly in the past two months to approve the creation of two new villages. State law allows villages to be established within towns and to set their own zoning regulations, and area officials say the new villages would be able to restrict the multifamily, high-density building that predominates in Kiryas Joel.\\nMany of the families in those towns also fled the crowded streets of New York City, moving here for the cleaner air, the safer communities and the open spaces, where the closest neighbor may not be so close.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re hard-working people who decided to move up here to pay less taxes and enjoy the quietness of country,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Garry Dugan, a retired New York City detective and the president of the South Blooming Grove Homeowners Association, the group that began the drive to create one of the villages.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a shame that it has come to us and them, but we feel like we had to form a village for no reason other than preserving our quality of life,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Dugan, who has lived in Blooming Grove for 26 years. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis has nothing to do with their religion.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nIt is not the first time that Kiryas Joel and its neighbors have clashed.\\nOver the years, there have been disputes \\xe2\\x80\\x94 over a water pipeline Kiryas Joel sought to build, for example, and whether the state should pay for a school system for its disabled students. There was also an argument in 1986 when 600 Kiryas Joel boys refused to board school buses driven by women. (The drivers are now all men.)\\nThe Satmar Hasidim share what they call a deep mystical connection to Kiryas Joel. They were led here by their founder, the Grand Rabbi Joel Teitelbaum, who saw in it the ideal place for his followers to raise large families away from the influences of the outside world. Hence the name of the village, which means Town of Joel.\\nAbout 3,000 families live here, many of them in boxy wood-frame homes built close to one another, with up to a dozen apartments stacked in four floors.\\nThe village has no parks or public playgrounds, so children play with their colorful plastic toys on small front yards.\\nA network of sidewalks twirl across the village, so the women, who do not drive, are able to walk to the clinic and supermarket. Baby strollers seem to be everywhere: in the lobbies of buildings, on sidewalks, outside the stores.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is a great place to raise our children; it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s easy to keep them away from the distractions of the city,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Judith Greenfeld, 34, whose family moved here from Williamsburg two decades ago.\\nAll but 3 of her 12 siblings live here.\\nMrs. Greenfeld and her husband, Joseph, 35, have five children, three boys and two girls, ages 3 to 13. The median age is 15, compared with 35 for the nation, according to the 2000 census. The village has one of the lowest median ages among communities nationwide with more than 5,000 residents.\\nThe Greenfelds live on a dead-end street, in a third-floor apartment across from a girls\\xe2\\x80\\x99 school. Like most families here, they speak more Yiddish than English and have no radio, computer or television at home. Mr. Greenfeld owns a tile shop in Monroe, just outside the village borders.\\nHis wife helps him run the business, which makes her a rare exception among Kiryas Joel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s women, who are married soon after they graduate from high school, work until they give birth to their second child and then become stay-at-home mothers. The men, meanwhile, board yellow school buses every morning and ride to New York City, to jobs in the diamond district or at B & H, the photo and video store near Herald Square.\\nBecause of the sheer size of the families (the average household here has six people, but it is not uncommon for couples to have 8 or 10 children), and because a vast majority of households subsist on only one salary, 62 percent of the local families live below poverty level and rely heavily on public assistance, which is another sore point among those who live in neighboring communities.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe just don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t understand why they have to keep pushing their expansionist ideas on us,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Charles J. Bohan, who is the supervisor of the Town of Blooming Grove and a resident of the new village, named South Blooming Grove.\\nOn Sept. 21, South Blooming Grove will hold its first election for mayor and for a four-member board of trustees. The state must still certify the results of the vote to create the village in Woodbury before elections there can be held.\\nMr. Szegedin, Kiryas Joel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s administrator, said his community was not deterred.\\n\"We have several different developers that want to sell land to Kiryas Joel, but if they can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do it, we can build up,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe can change our zoning code to allow high-rise apartments. The creation of these villages are not going to stop the growth in the village of Kiryas Joel.\"\\nMrs. Greenfeld agreed.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPeople don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t understand the conception of our people, of our religion,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no government or land or any other authority that can stop us from having babies,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said while her husband put out a plate of cheese blintzes, strawberries and sour cream.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not enough land, families will double up. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s always going to be room for the new families,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mrs. Greenfeld said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd if I have to slice up my apartment in two, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll do it, without doubt or hesitation.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n', 'In New York City, Bohemia is determined by real estate: artists gather in raffish neighborhoods where studio space is cheap; the new outposts of culture and consumption they establish make the quarter desirable, thus raising the rents to prohibitive levels; the artists then decamp for the next shabby enclave. Starting in the 1960\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, what New Yorkers meant by \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdowntown\\xe2\\x80\\x9d shifted from Greenwich Village to SoHo to TriBeCa to the Lower East Side. But Manhattan is a narrow island, and the portion of it dense enough to sustain the feeling of self-enclosure that Bohemia requires is quite small. And so, starting in the 1980\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, as rents skyrocketed, downtown began to migrate across the East River to Brooklyn.\\nBy now, those portions of Brooklyn first colonized by fleeing artists have almost completed the cycle of embourgeoisement. Williamsburg, the heart of Brooklyn\\xe2\\x80\\x99s gallery scene, has been thoroughly tamed by brasseries and boutiques; the kind of artists who aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t yet showing in those galleries are now moving to deepest, darkest Queens. But the middle-class householder geography of Queens offers too barren a soil for the rooting of a new Bohemia. Fortunately, there is lots more Brooklyn available.\\nThere is, of course, something wishful, or perhaps wistful, about this perpetual hunt for the urban El Dorado. A place that can shift around so easily sounds less like a neighborhood than a mentality, or a species of nostalgia. In most of America, after all, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdowntown\\xe2\\x80\\x9d simply means \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe city\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the place where things are close enough to one another that you can walk. But in New York, where every square inch feels urban, downtown is a refuge from \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a repudiation of \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the conventionality of Midtown, and mid-everything. Downtown is a concept, and perhaps an archaic one.\\nThe idea of Bohemia arose with the bourgeois city, against which it defined itself. In the Paris of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLa Boh\\xc3\\xa8me\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the Latin Quarter, circa 1830 \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the artist willingly courts starvation and disease as the price of freedom. The poet Rodolfo may be giddy as he shovels his manuscript into the fire to keep warm, but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s still the only source of fuel he has. Life was scarcely less desperate \\xe2\\x80\\x94 or less delightful \\xe2\\x80\\x94 in the downtown Manhattan of 1910, when the poet and propagandist John Reed, according to one biographer, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cate in obscure foreign restaurants, talked with the girls who walked the street in \\xe2\\x80\\x98Satan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Circus\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and caroused with Spanish longshoremen.\\nReed\\xe2\\x80\\x99s latter-day descendants are threatened not by penury but by gentrification. How can Bohemia contend with the twin baby stroller? The other day, walking around Fort Greene, one of Brooklyn\\xe2\\x80\\x99s current claimants to downtown cultural status, I stopped at an office building called 80 Arts. In the Museum of Contemporary African Diaspora Arts, or MoCADA, which occupies the ground floor, an exhibition of major black artists had just come down. I picked up some fliers from the counter. One, issued by a company called Downtown Babies, advertised \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCreative Play and Music Classes\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThemed Birthday Parties\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to be held at MoCADA. Downtown Babies \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the end of Bohemia as we know it.\\n80 Arts had been gutted and renovated as part of a \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccultural district\\xe2\\x80\\x9d established by a \\xe2\\x80\\x9clocal development corporation\\xe2\\x80\\x9d organized around the Brooklyn Academy of Music, the cultural mega-institution of Fort Greene. Here was a planned Bohemia \\xe2\\x80\\x94 surely a contradiction in terms. Indeed, many locals, and local organizations, had protested the development (as they are now even more loudly protesting the Atlantic Yards, a nearby mega-project featuring skyscrapers and a basketball stadium to be designed by Frank Gehry). But MoCADA owes its presence in Fort Greene to the cultural district; should the project be fully implemented, a new theater and public library will be built as well.\\nIn short, downtown, or the idea of downtown, has become thoroughly implicated in the cultural and economic forces that it once resisted with every ounce of its scruffy integrity. The misfits and longhairs and revolutionaries deemed unassimilable by mainstream culture in John Reed\\xe2\\x80\\x99s day are now considered \\xe2\\x80\\x9cedgy\\xe2\\x80\\x9d; and edge, in turn, attracts sneaker stores and bistros and cultural entrepreneurs and even young couples with strollers. The derri\\xc3\\xa8re-garde keeps catching up with the avant-garde; the avant-garde falls prey to its own lurid appeal. If Rodolfo\\xe2\\x80\\x99s artist pal Marcello were around today, his gallery opening would be catered by Absolut.\\nAnd so the Bohemias of yesteryear have gone the way of Reed\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Spanish longshoremen. But is that so bad? Take a walk in Fort Greene, an ethnically and economically mixed neighborhood with tree-lined blocks of fine brick homes. A block away from 80 Arts, beyond the town house that the painter David Salle has lavishly rehabilitated, lies the lime-green Habana Outpost, an eco-friendly cafe where mothers push downtown babies on swings amid racks of folkloric skirts, priced to sell. And then, moving up Fulton Street, once a commercial swamp, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the wine store and the soul-food restaurant and the beloved Cake Man Raven. A few blocks away stands the Brooklyn Academy of Music, which has been irreproachably avant-garde since long before there was any money in it. Fort Greene feels less like Bohemia than what the scholar Joel Kotkin calls an \\xe2\\x80\\x9celite urban enclave\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a place suited to the sophisticated tastes of the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cknowledge workers\\xe2\\x80\\x9d who now propel New York\\xe2\\x80\\x99s economy.\\nBut the wheel of development that brought in those young cosmopolites, and priced out a number of the area\\xe2\\x80\\x99s longtime, predominantly black residents, has not stopped turning: the Atlantic Yards project threatens to disrupt Fort Greene\\xe2\\x80\\x99s delicate ecology once again. We want to preserve our precious and beloved utopias like paperweight worlds; but the city \\xe2\\x80\\x94 at least this city \\xe2\\x80\\x94 will not permit it.\\n', 'LAST week I was trying to find gifts for newborn twins adopted by an architect friend and his graphic designer husband who live in Los Angeles. They are two new additions to the many, many children I know now.

Its high-design offerings make it a prime location for the sharpest \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and sometimes most perverse \\xe2\\x80\\x94 children\\xe2\\x80\\x99s products.\\nMini Jake was started by David Jacobs and his wife, Inga Rogers, as an offshoot of Two Jakes, the office furniture store that Mr. Jacobs owns with his brother. In 2005, he put out a couple of cribs in the shop, and after witnessing the rabid response, opened Mini Jake, which is dedicated to children\\xe2\\x80\\x99s furniture. Mini Jake soon outgrew the space like training pants, and moved into this 3,000-square-foot warehouse in June.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cEveryone who was buying Dwell and Eames chairs suddenly had kids,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Jacobs said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere was a void to fill.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nWith 20-foot ceilings and two skylights, the light-drenched space is divided into sections that include toys, books, bags, buggies, bedding, newborn essentials and, in the center, a grid of cribs, dressers, rockers and bassinets, all as shiny and presentable as new cars. The store is dustless, colorful and clean-lined \\xe2\\x80\\x94 sort of how I imagine a day care center in Copenhagen to look.\\nAnd, actually, as I walked around the store, I began to notice a predominance of Nordic names: Flensted Mobiles, Svan Bouncer, a loom from the Swedish toy company Brio. In the front of the store were pieces of layered foam carved into fish, pig, giraffe and elephant shapes, made by the Danish company bObles ($39 each). Just now being introduced in the United States, they seem like cooler, chic Nerf balls. A box showed a child standing on one of them, with blunt-cut bangs and a fulfilled Danish smile.\\nI hovered over the Haba Kugelbahn ($84.95), a set of troughs and chutes for marbles, which I wanted to tear open and play with on the chalkboard-topped Fundy play table ($399.95). Then I spent a long time marveling over the Antquarium ($24.99), an ant farm filled with a clear gel so you can fully see your pet insects at work. Everything was so spotless and clever, it made all the detritus I grew up with \\xe2\\x80\\x94 plastic highchairs, Legos, Fisher-Price toys, awkward potty seats \\xe2\\x80\\x94 look like clunky artifacts from a primitive culture.\\nIT was surprisingly quiet when I was there. Two fashionable mothers sauntered around, their children comatose in strollers. One woman was in a trendy lime-green sack dress with her long hair loosely bunched up in the back. She roamed around the diaper bags with the same focus she had probably given to a pair of Jimmy Choo slingbacks 10 years earlier.\\nOne contraption that caught my eye was the Stokke Xplory stroller, which has an elevated seat and a horizontal bed for a baby. Intended tor lift your children away from the street and place them  closer to you, the stroller looks like an overdesigned lunch cart. According to the Mini Jake Web site, the design is also meant to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cstimulate the all important social interaction between parent and child,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d thus promoting bonding.\\nThe complete stroller, which includes an attachable bassinet, costs $999. It is the most expensive stroller in the store, even more expensive than the notorious Bugaboo Frog, which at $759 transformed the industry when it appeared on the market in 1999, rejiggering the price point for the simple stroller much like Starbucks normalized the $2 coffee.\\nNot all of the products here are from Northern Europe. Of the eight cribs displayed on the floor, four are made by local designers, including one from Oeuf in Brooklyn ($824 for birch) that can transform into a toddler bed if you buy the $202 conversion kit. Supposedly this makes the child\\xe2\\x80\\x99s transition from crib to a first bed less upsetting, giving parents a better chance at catching a bit more sleep.\\nMany of the pricey items here justify themselves by purporting to be adaptable as your child grows: bassinet to buggy, crib to bed. One of the odder looking pieces was the Cocoon from the Phil & Teds line ($59.95). The thick, bright green insulated bag is used to transport your baby but looks disturbingly like a beer cooler.\\nDespite all of this selective high-tech merchandise, Mr. Jacobs is not at all the design snob you might assume he would be. There may be items here that give you sticker shock, or wipe out your child\\xe2\\x80\\x99s college fund before you have even started it, but he and the store give off a good energy. He and Ms. Rogers have two children \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Jackson, 6, and Phoebe, 3 \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and Mr. Jacobs comes off as your normal, honest, mellow dad operating on one REM cycle.\\nFor the twins, he suggested I go local and get \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBow-Wow Bugs a Bug\\xe2\\x80\\x9d ($12.95), a book by the New York artists Mark Newgarden and Megan Montague Cash, and the album \\xe2\\x80\\x9cRocket Ship Beach\\xe2\\x80\\x9d ($14.95) by the rocker turned children\\xe2\\x80\\x99s music megastar, Dan Zanes. I bought both the book and the CD, hoping that Zanes had not achieved Bono-like status in the children\\xe2\\x80\\x99s music scene on the West Coast as he has in Brooklyn.

Even when he wrote \\nto Patrick Henry College about the year that had set the course \\nof his life-the year when he, a homeschooled missionary\\'s kid \\nfrom a depressed suburb of Akron, got to see President George \\nW. Bush in person-Derek kept his hubris in check. \"I would be a \\nfool to believe I made it through the past few months by my might \\nand my power, for truly it was by the Lord\\'s grace and His Spirit \\nalone!\"\\nDerek was not one of the school\\'s usual incoming freshman \\nstars known as \"the 1600s\"-the handful of kids each year who \\nget perfect scores on their SATs and ignore courting letters from \\nHarvard and Stanford to come to Patrick Henry. What he had was \\nnot something the six-year-old college could easily boast about \\nin press releases, but what it valued much more: a near-perfect \\nbalance of ambition and humility, the one impulse pushing him \\ntoward the White House and the other always reminding him \\nWho was really in charge.\\nIn a few heady months during the fall of 2004, the Bush campaign \\nhad served as one endless, amazing high school field trip-better \\nthan going to Europe or Disneyland or Papua, New Guinea, \\nwhere his family once lived in a house on stilts. He had made \\nphone calls and knocked on doors in the critical swing districts in \\nOhio, near where he lived. He had won a contest for registering \\nmore than 100 voters. He had learned to take verbal abuse with \\ngrace. He had created a minor local celebrity by writing articles \\nand flyers under the fogyish nom de plume \"Franz Holbein\" who \\ncomplained about \"some of the most appalling displays of disrespect \\nthis nation has ever seen.\" Twenty minutes before the polls \\nclosed, a car full of rowdies whizzed by him, screaming \"Kerry \\nwon! Kerry won!\" He prayed it couldn\\'t be true, and his prayers \\nwere answered. In the battle between the \"forces of righteousness \\nand unrighteousness,\" the right side had won.\\n\"Those few months have had a powerful impact on my life in \\npreparing me for the ministry of political activism,\" he wrote to \\nPatrick Henry. \"If in any matter I can bring glory to my God and \\nKing, may He grant me the grace to do just that.\"\\nIt\\'s not just that Derek was a missionary\\'s kid and knew how \\nto say the right things. Patrick Henry prides itself on not being \\nyour run-of-the-mill Bible college: It doesn\\'t give automatic preference \\nto MKs, who can be just as rotten as any kids. Instead the \\nschool takes the measure of its students constantly, probing the \\nnature of each individual\\'s personal relationship with Jesus Christ \\nwith the care and trepidation of a parent monitoring a fever, or a \\nschoolgirl checking whether you\\'re still her best friend. Under \\nthat microscope, Derek glowed.\\nGod\\'s voice was like the sound track to the movie of Derek\\'s \\nlife, lending texture and meaning to every action. In return, Derek \\nthanked God for everything. He thanked Him when a seemingly \\nchance meeting led to a great internship at the local Republican \\nheadquarters. \"The Lord just dropped that one into my lap!\" He \\nthanked Him for his mom sending his favorite granola bars, for his \\nsister passing her driving test, for the extra cheese on his turkey \\nsub. He thanked Him for his new used car, although it was dark \\npurple and the AC didn\\'t work and the windows seemed to be \\nglued shut. He thanked Him for his after-school job at Leach\\'s \\nMeats and Sweets down the road, where he worked in the chilly \\nback room hacking up raw chickens and grinding up beef to stuff \\ninto their \"famous\" sausages while tolerating the boss\\'s son\\'s endless \\ntracks of AC/DC (\"the worst band in the whole wide world\").\\n\"It\\'s really been a blessing,\" he told me one day as he wiped his \\nknife on an apron streaked with bloodstains.\\nIn the year before he left for college, Derek had moved down \\nto the basement of his parents\\' house in Barberton, six miles \\nsouth of Akron. In the evenings, his mom, Donna Archer, would \\ngo down there to drop off his clean laundry \"and see if he\\'s ready \\nto hit the hay, and I\\'d find him down on his knees praying. As a \\nChristian mom, nothing thrills me more. Nobody was watching \\nhim; it\\'s the real thing. He doesn\\'t do it to please us. You can see \\nGod\\'s spirit at work in him.\"\\n\"Because of that,\" his mom added, \"I\\'m not worried if he \\nheads into politics.\"\\nFor Patrick Henry College, Derek was a white sheep, the son \\nyou were pretty sure wouldn\\'t roll his eyes at you the minute you \\nturned your head or sneak a cigarette outside his dorm window at \\nnight. The school thought of itself as a training ground for political \\nmissionaries; its founder, Michael Farris, traveled the country \\nrecruiting conservative Christian kids like Derek who were \\nbright, politically minded, and itching to be near the president. \\nFarris was aware of the risks of launching them into the cutthroat \\nand dirty world of politics: He could unwittingly turn out to be \\nthe agent of their corruption, involving them in what Derek \\nhad once heard described by a pastor as \"an innately wicked endeavor.\" \\nSo Derek was a particular gem, a boy who, as much as \\nanyone this side of heaven, seemed incorruptible.\\n\"Okay. Here goes,\" Derek said, as he spotted the Welcome Students \\nsign hanging in Founders Hall. Like most of the kids who \\ngo to Patrick Henry, Derek was homeschooled by his parents all \\nthe way through high school, so college could be a shock. But during \\norientation week the campus still felt warm and familiar, like \\na big homeschool family reunion. The central buildings and dorms \\nwere packed with typically oversized homeschooling families-ten-year-old  \\ngirls pushing strollers, toddlers scrambling after their \\npregnant moms like baby ducks. The little kids were eerily independent \\nand well behaved; they sat in circles on the grass or outside \\nthe cafeteria, playing games or reading the campus maps for \\nfun. The incoming freshmen boys, meanwhile, looked like children \\nplaying the role of adults in a high school play, with crisp \\nwhite polo shirts, new leather computer bags, and their last bits of \\nacne. The girls wore twin sets over their khakis or black slacks, \\nwhich surprised Derek\\'s mom. \"Okay, this is going to be more casual \\ndress for the girls than I thought,\" said Donna, whose daughter \\ngoes to a Christian school where skirts are required. But, she \\nadded, \"I\\'m happy for the lack of tattoos and piercings.\"\\nA handful of families looked like reenactors lost on their way \\nto Colonial Williamsburg: mothers in braids carrying babies in \\nbonnets, girls in their best Laura Ingalls Wilder white-collared \\ndresses taking a stroll around the lake-a tableau that made the \\ncampus feel a century-not an hour-away from downtown \\nWashington, D.C. The parking lot was jammed with vans bearing \\nmessages on their bumpers: TRUTH, or BUSH/CHENEY, or LIFE. \\nOne license plate read MOMOF8.\\nDerek, who has blue eyes and sharply parted blond hair, already \\nhad business casual down. He was wearing an oxford shirt \\nand khakis and sneakers that looked recently cleaned. Like many \\nhomeschooled boys, Derek seemed both old and young for his \\nage. If he was in a good mood, he bounced more than walked and \\nwhistled, like Dennis without the menace, or an old contented \\npreacher lost in happy thoughts. With his tall frame, gangly arms, \\nand big grin, he was built for stand-up comedy but he was more \\noften straining to seem more serious. He was polite and sometimes \\nabsurdly formal, and when he was talking to an adult and \\nfeeling nervous, he used constructions more appropriate for the \\nwitness stand. (\"Yes, ma\\'am, I have been to this campus on two \\nprior occasions.\")\\nThe campus is tiny, less like an Ivy League college than like a \\nHollywood set of an old Ivy League school, with one main building \\nand several dorms grouped around a lake, all in Federalist \\nstyle. The art in Founders Hall is designed to remind the students \\nthat America was founded as a Christian nation-a gallery \\nof portraits of the Founding Fathers, all copies, leads up the staircase \\nto the picture of Patrick Henry at the second Virginia convention, \\na shaft of light from Heaven guiding his speech. \"Harvard \\nfor Homeschoolers,\" founder Michael Farris likes to call it, invoking \\nthe Harvard of earlier days, whose laws instructed students \\nto \"know God and Jesus Christ.\"\\nThe last time Derek was on campus, his assigned dorm hadn\\'t \\nbeen built yet, and when he saw it, he was impressed. \"So stately,\" \\nhe said, noting the chandelier in the entranceway and the winding \\nstaircase leading up to his room on the second floor. But the \\nfirst thing that struck me about the boys\\' dorms was what was \\nmissing. Even during moving week, there were no flip-flops and \\nshorts, because the dress code encourages \"glorifying God with \\nyour appearance.\" There were no iPod speakers perched on \\nanyone\\'s windows, shuffling from Beyonc\\xc3\\x88 to Coldplay, because \\niTunes lists are monitored and headphones are encouraged. There \\nwere no movie posters zeroing in on Scarlett Johansson\\'s cleavage, \\nand no live cleavage either, because girls are required to \\ncover their chests and, in any event, girls aren\\'t allowed in boys\\' \\ndorms. There was no impatient \"Mom, aren\\'t you guys going \\nsomewhere for dinner?\" and no sneaking around to figure out \\nwhere the rush parties were because at Patrick Henry there are \\nhardly ever parties, and drinking and dancing are not allowed. \\nThere were no heaps of clothes on the floor, or open bags of \\nCheetos. The only thing left blocking the hallway for any amount \\nof time was an ironing board-an ironing board, in a boys\\' dorm!\\nThroughout the year, school administrators conduct room \\nchecks to monitor cleanliness, but Derek did not really need that \\nincentive. Without any prodding, he set up his room like a Republican \\nFelix Unger. Above his desk he hung a signed Bush/ \\nCheney poster (\"To Mr. Archer, with deepest appreciation for \\nyour support\"), a promotional calendar from the Bush campaign, \\nand a postcard of Ronald Reagan (\"If we ever forget that we are \\none nation under God then we will be a nation gone under.\"). He \\nunpacked his favorite authors-Joshua Harris, Rush Limbaugh, \\nJohn Owen-and his prize possession, a Bible bound in black \\nleather that he got when he was twelve, its front cover so worn \\nfrom use that you have to divine the once-gold monogram with \\nyour finger, like the Shroud of Turin. Above his desk sat a woodblock \\nI\\'ve seen in many a Republican congressman\\'s office. It read: \\nTRUST ME.\\nAlthough Patrick Henry has rules about movie watching, \\nsome students keep secret stashes of DVDs in their bottom drawers, \\nbut Derek brought only one-Surf Ninjas, a martial arts spoof \\nabout two surfer brothers who discover they are long-lost princes \\nfrom a South China Sea island kingdom and use their newly discovered \\nspecial powers to overthrow an evil madman dictator. (\"I \\nenjoy the kind of humor it presents.\") He\\'d seen some movies in \\ntheaters, but not very many. \"You really have to be careful about \\nhow much you consume,\" he said. \"Watch one movie now and \\nagain with a bad message, and it will help you know what\\'s going \\non in the culture. But if you have a constant diet of that, that\\'s \\nwhere it gets destructive.\"\\nHe brought only a handful of CDs by contemporary Christian \\nartists such as Steven Curtis Chapman and Mercy Me-the kind \\nof syrupy Christian ballads about which the AC/DC-loving boys \\nat Leach\\'s had given him endless grief.\\n\"You don\\'t have to be careful when you listen to them,\" said \\nDonna.\\n\"Yes,\" Derek added, \"the gospel message is clear. Unlike some \\nsecular songs, which leave you with an empty feeling.\"\\nDerek indulged in excess in only one area, and this, too, he \\ncould trace back to his mom. His closet was bulging with clothes-suit \\npants and jackets and dress shirts and T-shirts and ties. But \\nthis display was not exactly what it seemed. These were hand-me-downs, \\ncollected from an aunt \"with fashionable inklings\" and \\nvarious church-run thrift stores. And while most teenage boys \\nmight find it annoying to be sent to school with plaid vests and suit \\njackets to \"grow into\" and dozens of shirts and ties collected from \\nchurch sales, Derek did not see it this way. To him, it was an embarrassment \\nof riches, so much so that he decided to bring it up \\nwith his mom.\\n\"I feel it\\'s a bit flashy, if you will,\" he said. \"I mean, you don\\'t \\nhave to wear something different every single day,\" he added, in a \\ntone that from him counted as defiance.\\n\"Well, I\\'m glad you don\\'t have a lack,\" she said. \"It\\'s better \\nnot to wear the same thing over and over. Girls notice that kind \\nof thing-that kind of lack of hygiene-more than guys.\"\\nOutside, the kids were comparing schedules-something \\nnew for homeschoolers used to learning at their family\\'s pace. \\nOver and over they recited the freshman routine-\"Latin, History, \\nLogic, Lit\"-a litany meant to calm them down. Derek had \\nbeen warned that students at Patrick Henry \"study, like, fifteen \\nhours a day,\" that they stay up all night or wake up at 4 A.M. and \\nare generally tightly wound and type A, much more so than he is. \\nHe was pretty sure he could keep up, but some other freshmen \\nalready seemed on the verge of snapping under the pressure.\\n\"I\\'ve been planning my classes for the last year, and now the \\nschedule\\'s not going to work,\" said one girl with a very tight \\nponytail, emerging from a meeting with her adviser.\\nHomeschoolers are not the most obvious raw material for a \\ncollege whose main mission is to train a new generation of Christian \\npoliticians. Politics, after all, is the most chaotic and social \\nof professions, and many students arrive at Patrick Henry having \\nnever shared a classroom with anyone other than their siblings. In \\nconservative circles, however, homeschoolers are considered to be \\nsomething of an elite group-rough around the edges but pure in \\ntheir focus, capacity for work, and ideological clarity. The kids \\nat Patrick Henry were raised advocating for the rights of homeschoolers; \\nduring orientation week, they shared stories of lobbying \\ncongressmen sympathetic to their cause or volunteering for \\ncampaigns. Most homeschoolers take field trips to the statehouse \\nthe way public school kids visit the zoo or the pumpkin patch.\\nTheir parents raised them tenderly, not with the intention of \\nsheltering them forever, but of grooming them for their ultimate \\nmission: to \"shape the culture and take back the nation.\" It\\'s a \\nphrase repeated in homeschooling circles like a prayer, or a chant, \\nor a company slogan. It shows up in homeschoolers\\' textbooks \\nand essays and church youth groups; their parents whisper it in \\ntheir ears like a secret destiny: There\\'s a world out there, a lost and \\nfallen world, and you alone can rescue it. Derek said it to a reporter \\nwho profiled him in the Akron Beacon Journal during his senior year \\nof high school. His father, Mark Archer, read Deuteronomy to \\nhim and explained how Moses never got to enter the Promised \\nLand; it\\'s the young Joshua who would lead the way to salvation.\\n\"If there\\'s any hope in this country, it\\'s from you kids,\" his dad \\ntold him. \"Morally, there is so much bad going on in this country. \\nIt will be you kids coming out of the homeschooling movement, \\nyour generation, who will do it.\"\\n\"Homeschooling does give a hope,\" his mother said, more \\ngently.\\nAt school the upperclassmen echoed their parent\\'s voices: \\n\"We\\'re the salt of the earth and it\\'s no good if the salt is kept in a \\nshaker,\" said Matthew du Mee, one of the school\\'s star graduates.\\n\"It\\'s like training knights,\" said a junior. \"We wear thick armor \\nto make the battle easier. We\\'re not saying we\\'re closer to \\nHeaven, but we go above and beyond the call of duty.\"\\nThe world out there, this enemy, was something the freshmen \\nhad seen only in bits and pieces-at summer jobs at 7-Elevens, \\nplaying sports at the local high school, or while changing channels. \\nTheir parents might have told them horror stories of drugs \\nand date rape and gay-pride parades, but most of them could \\nhardly imagine what those things might look like. But the Patrick \\nHenry freshmen, like nerdy teenage boys everywhere, loved science \\nfiction and its cinematic equivalent-Star Wars and Star Trek \\nand Ender\\'s Game and Surf Ninjas-stories in which a race of morally \\nand intellectually superior boys must leave their childhood home \\nprematurely to go fight enemies who want to destroy an already-mostly-destroyed \\nnation. And the boys always won in the end. \\nSubstitute Hillary Clinton for Darth Vader or the Klingons, and \\ntheir destiny suddenly made sense to them.\\nCampus in the first few days of orientation week felt like Jedi \\nAcademy or Battle School in the Belt or Hogwarts School of \\nWitchcraft and Wizardry (if they\\'d been allowed to read Harry \\nPotter). The boys were suddenly faced with an army of other \\nChosen Ones just like them, and they found it discomfiting. \\nThey knew the adults around them were looking for the next \\nNapoleon, the next Alexander, or at the very least the next Antonin \\nScalia, and they wanted to be It. At the endless series of \\nlunches and dinners under the big white tent, they sized each \\nother up, jockeying for position, and flexing their muscles in \\ncrude and awkward ways. They bragged about their special \\npowers in ways that they would cringe to remember a couple of \\nmonths later.\\nExcerpted from God\\'s Harvard by Hanna Rosin Copyright \\xc2\\xa9 2007 by Hanna Rosin.

But for all the sniping from adults who resent this territorial invasion, the onslaught shows no sign of letting up. In fact, one of its latest flash points is the local bar.\\nWhen the owners of Union Hall \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a moody, dark-paneled bar and brunch spot in Park Slope, Brooklyn \\xe2\\x80\\x94 recently posted a sign that read \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPlease, No Strollers\\xe2\\x80\\x9d under another one reading \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo One Under 21 Admitted,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d they did not see it as a declaration of war with the neighborhood\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sizable population of young parents.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe word gets out that this is a place for baby buggies to go, we end up with 8 to 10 strollers, or 15,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Jim Carden, an owner. He explained that the goal was simply to make sure that the preferred transportation for toddlers of the stay-at-home parents who had adopted the lounge as an afternoon hangout would not crowd out the regular patrons.\\nPerhaps he underestimated the neighborhood\\xe2\\x80\\x99s vocal and proactive parents. Local parenting blogs were soon bristling with denunciations.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis was a perfect winter moms\\xe2\\x80\\x99 group place for those of us with infants going stir-crazy,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d wrote one woman on onlytheblogknowsbrooklyn.com, wondering testily why local mothers could not at least drop in for \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca beer once a week when it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not crowded.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nOf course, the practice of bringing babies and young children to bars is hardly exclusive to Park Slope. The issue has been debated in online message boards in cities like Minneapolis, Philadelphia and Washington.\\nA woman in Boston, recently posting to yelp.com, a national, user-generated city-guide site, seemed appalled to see a 7-year-old next to her at a bar. (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere were cubes, crayons and candy on top of the bar,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she wrote. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDoes anyone else think there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s something wrong with that?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d)\\nIn England, the JD Wetherspoon chain of pubs recently implemented a rule making sure that parents who bring young children not only eat a meal, but stay for no more than two rounds. After a recent smoking ban, more families have been bringing children to pubs, and a spokesman for the chain was quoted by the BBC as saying, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOnce the children have had their meal, we can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see a reason why they should still be in the pub.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nIn New York, too, the smoking ban has altered the bar\\xe2\\x80\\x99s image. No longer a den of adult sin, the local tavern is now seen as an attractive option for afternoon gatherings among parents. (Neither New York state nor city law forbids minors in bars, although state regulations say children under 16 must be accompanied by an adult, a State Liquor Authority spokesman said.)\\nIt makes extra sense, parents said, in Park Slope, where the demarcation between generations has blurred \\xe2\\x80\\x94 in Brooklyn, hoodies and skateboard sneakers constitute a uniform for parents as well as their 5-year-olds.\\nWhile critics of bringing children to bars are vocal, some parents have embraced the habit with gusto. In recent years, mothers in Manhattan and in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, gathered for Wednesday afternoon cocktail mixers called Tots and Tonic. One former attendee, Christen Clifford, a writer and actress who now lives in Jackson Heights, Queens, proudly recalled breast-feeding her son, Felix, at the bar before ordering a martini.\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s one way of denying that your youthful exploits come with a shelf life, she acknowledged. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPsychologically, you feel like, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Oh, my life hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t changed that much,\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xc2\\xa0\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9calthough of course it completely has.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nNeal Pollack, the author of the book \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAlternadad,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said that Generation X parents \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the types who sport gray whiskers in their beards and Vampire Weekend downloads on their iPods \\xe2\\x80\\x94 \\xe2\\x80\\x9cvalue lifestyle above most things.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a bad thing that people want to continue a semblance of their pre-parenthood lifestyle,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Pollack, who lives in Los Angeles. Going to rock shows and bars, he added, is \\xe2\\x80\\x9cjust what their lives were.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nIn a sense, Park Slope is the perfect testing ground for the practice of extreme generational commingling at the local saloon. It is a neighborhood of young parents, of the sort who consider themselves laid back enough that they can carve out some time to knock back a few with junior.\\nBesides, many like to think of the neighborhood, with its elegant town houses and literary air, as London or Dublin in miniature. In those cities, the pub often doubles as a community center.\\nDawn D\\xe2\\x80\\x99Arcy, the manager of the Gate, a bar in Park Slope that routinely sees groups of parents and children drop by during the afternoon, agreed, saying that the Gate was \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmodeled on an Irish pub.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is a place where people bring dogs in, this is a \\xe2\\x80\\x98local,\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xc2\\xa0\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFamilies are a part of that.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nBut Park Slope being what it is, the Union Hall debate soon took on metaphorical dimensions. This, after all, is a place where the stroller serves as a symbol: to parents, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a token of shared purpose in what many consider a child-rearing Eden; to critics, often artfully scruffy singles who feel crowded out by more affluent stroller-pushers, it connotes relentless gentrification.\\nThe founders of a local blog, takebacktheisland.wordpress.com, which purports to advocate the rights of the childless, were not alone among bloggers who interpreted Union Hall\\xe2\\x80\\x99s gesture as a line in the sand.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe salute Union Hall for following our lead and sticking up for the rights of childless adults who don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to deal with someone\\xe2\\x80\\x99s loud, crying infant when they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re trying to relax and have a drink,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said one of the site\\xe2\\x80\\x99s founders, (both women in their 20s), who uses the screen-name Ruby Stoneheart, in an e-mail response to this reporter\\xe2\\x80\\x99s question about the dispute.\\nThe move by Union Hall is not the first time a local business invited censure by taking on the stroller class. Last year, the two-story Barnes & Noble on Seventh Avenue posted a sign restricting strollers to a designated area on its ground floor; the sign was removed after a neighborhood outcry. In 2005, a bartender at the Patio Lounge, a bar on Fifth Avenue, posted a sign \\xe2\\x80\\x94 still known as the infamous \\xe2\\x80\\x9cStroller Manifesto\\xe2\\x80\\x9d on local parents\\xe2\\x80\\x99 blogs \\xe2\\x80\\x94 that asked, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat is it with people bringing their kids into bars?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nTo members of a previous generation, as well as to the proprietors of Union Hall, it would seem like a valid question. Mr. Carden insisted the ban was pragmatic, not dogmatic. He explained that Union Hall contains any number of potential child-hazards that could constitute a liability for the owners \\xe2\\x80\\x94 an open staircase, a full-size boccie court involving \\xe2\\x80\\x9chard balls thrown around.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSometimes there are broken glasses,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he added. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is a bar.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n', 'WHEN Englishmen in 1816 gave the area midway between Williamsburg, Brooklyn, and Jamaica, Queens, the rather uncreative name of Middle Village, it seemed they ensured that it would largely stay off people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s maps.\\nNot that the residents are complaining.  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a very consistent neighborhood,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Gary Giordano, who has been district manager of the community board since 1989. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou move here, you know what it\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll look like in 10, 15, 20 years. You raise your kids here. And your kids raise your grandkids here.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nSince a housing boom in the 1920s, this two-square-mile pocket of Queens  \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the generally accepted boundaries are the Long Island Expressway, Cooper Avenue, the huge Mount Olivet Cemetery and Woodhaven Boulevard  \\xe2\\x80\\x94 has enjoyed the kind of lifestyle one might expect in suburbia farther afield.\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a neighborhood where the mothers pushing strollers through the various parks are actually strolling. No texting. No ramping up cardio. Nary an iPod in sight. The lack of a Whole Foods or Citarella is made up for by a scattershot assortment of specialty stores: bakers, butchers and grocers run less by district managers and more by local shopkeepers who know your name and your children\\xe2\\x80\\x99s names.\\nThe 2000 census population of 28,984 showed just a three-person increase over the 1990 population. Ethnically, Middle Village is about a third Italian, 14 percent Irish, 10 percent German and 7 percent Polish. All that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s left of its English heritage  are the names of its streets and the small but lavish gardens.\\nAmong the newcomers are Carol Whelan and her brother Alan, who paid $777,000 for their two-family home a few months ago. They came from Ireland, and moved in along with Mr. Whelan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s stepson, 12, and Ms. Whelan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s daughter, 14, finding in Middle Village a less crowded feeling than in  nearby Ridgewood, Glendale or Maspeth.\\nManhattan officials talked in recent years of a freight tunnel under New York Harbor that would spill out into Middle Village, followed by a major cargo hub, with many big-rig trucks every day.  But residents have been deft in taking evasive action.\\nAs Robert Holden of the often-fierce Juniper Park Civic Association put it: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDevelopment and construction and big projects, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s considered progress in some neighborhoods. Not here.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nUltimately, it is unclear whether the plan died because of local opposition or complications with federal financing. But Mr. Holden is happy to credit locals.  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re solid, friendly blue-collar people,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Holden said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe backbone of the city, we call ourselves.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nMr. Holden\\xe2\\x80\\x99s group has also had a strong hand in various neighborhood rezoning efforts,  including the addition of so-called textural zones, which, since 2005, have sought to ensure that  multifamily homes do not predominate. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the kind of coziness that Mr. Holden, 56, says keeps his  23-year-old daughter pining for home, all the way from her sixth-floor walk-up on 79th Street in Manhattan, just off the F.D.R. Drive.\\nWHAT YOU\\xe2\\x80\\x99LL FIND\\nYes, Queens in general is packed with the squat single-family homes of the sort that were made famous by Archie and Edith Bunker of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAll in the Family\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in the 1970s, and George Costanza\\xe2\\x80\\x99s parents in \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSeinfeld\\xe2\\x80\\x9d 20 years later. But the houses here are often embellished as mini-manors. Because so many people live their whole lives in the neighborhood, their homes are sometimes passed between generations, avoiding the marketplace entirely.\\nOne property on 84th Street, for example, is on the market for the first time since 1925; it still has its original stained-glass windows and cathedral ceilings from the era.\\nAs for the commercial parts of the neighborhood, they have been gaining in sophistication. Toyo, a Japanese restaurant, and Uvarara, a wine bar, recently opened on Metropolitan Avenue, the main business strip (outside of the area\\xe2\\x80\\x99s two large malls). And then there is C\\xe2\\x80\\x99Spa, which offers decidedly Manhattanite metrosexual treatments like facials and waxings for men.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cEveryone lives close to the parks here,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Luis Tavera, a hospital union worker whose recent move here was prompted by his wife\\xe2\\x80\\x99s new teaching job. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s great after spending the day in the thick of Manhattan. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve all got the great Juniper Valley Park, and I dare say that all the surrounding cemeteries basically make you feel like you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re in a park anyway.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d When you ride along the edge of a cemetery on the Q54 bus down Metropolitan Avenue, he joked, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe neighbors are quiet here.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nWHAT YOU\\xe2\\x80\\x99LL PAY\\nPrices have declined almost 10 percent in the last year, said Salvatore Crifasi, 53, president of Crifasi Real Estate, a local resident who met his wife, Catherine, by Juniper Valley Park when he was 17 and she was 15.\\nMost single-family properties sell for $500,000 to $700,000, with some new condominiums near the M line subway terminal going for $300,000 to $400,000.\\nMultifamilies often have  scant parking (because they have gone up where single-family homes used to be). They run from around $400,000, for older properties, to the million-dollar mark for new construction.\\nMr. Crifasi, who has been selling real estate in Middle Village since 1974, said about two-thirds of the buyers and sellers were \\xe2\\x80\\x9clocals playing musical chairs in their hometown, none of these yipsters who have been moving into places like Astoria or Williamsburg.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nThere are 97 one-, two- and three-family homes on the market, 44 of which are single-family; an additional 24 condos are for sale as well, Mr. Crifasi said.\\nTwo-family homes, like the Whelans\\xe2\\x80\\x99, are a hot commodity  \\xe2\\x80\\x94  especially because renting out half of a home helps finances in these troubled times. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFour out of five calls I get are asking for two-family homes,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Alex Benisatto, a local associate with Coldwell Banker.\\nLast year, 199 homes spent time on the market and 141 sold,  Mr. Crifasi said. The average sale price was $592,575; average time on the market was 84 days. That compares with 106 homes on the market so far this year, with 37 closing after an average of 93 days, for an average price of $582,196.\\nTHE COMMUTE\\nIn July, the Q54 was rerouted to add a stop at the Shops at Atlas Park (which opened in 2006 and is named after the bodybuilder Charles Atlas, who was a Middle Villager). That line also makes a stop at the M station, which terminates at Metropolitan Avenue. This means no sardine-can experiences as you board the train into Manhattan. It takes about 30 minutes to get to Midtown. The M, which now ends downtown, is to be extended through Brooklyn, to the DeKalb and Atlantic Avenue stations and almost to Coney Island.\\nWHAT TO DO\\nThe Middle Village Chamber of Commerce\\xe2\\x80\\x99s third annual Community Day was Sept. 7. About 5,000 residents attended the festivities in Juniper Valley Park, for free amusement rides, popcorn, soda and other  treats.\\nParents often let their children play in the fountains at Atlas Park. In the winter months, those same children may very well be taken to the hockey rink now available at Juniper Valley Park.\\nLucy Accardo, who is involved in a group she called Mom\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Club, says mothers are tightly knit and regularly meet up at the local New York Sports Club or Borders bookstore (where employees hold readings for children).\\nMrs. Accardo and her husband, Claudio, have four children, ages 3, 6, 7 and 9. She also runs a parenting health and wellness business via the Web, mykidsaremyboss.com. She says she likes Middle Village\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tranquil pace. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI grew up in Astoria, lived there forever and still never really got to know my neighbors, because they were always moving in or out,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd it was always changing and growing, trying to be a mini-Manhattan. Middle Village is the opposite of that. I take the stroller to pick up my kids after school and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m actually pushing the stroller down the street, not jamming it into the car.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nTHE SCHOOLS\\nThere are three public elementaries: Nos. 128, 49 and 87.  Public School 128 recently switched from a kindergarten-through-Grade 5 setup to encompass Grades 6, 7 and 8.\\nHigh school students go to Grover Cleveland, Forest Hills or Newtown. According to Andrew Jacob of the city Education Department, Forest Hills had the best SAT averages last year: 458 in reading, 486 in math and 454 in writing, versus 488, 504 and 481 statewide. Grover Cleveland\\xe2\\x80\\x99s averages were 399, 434 and 398; Newtown\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 387, 439 and 384.\\nAmong parochial schools are Our Lady of Hope and St. Margaret\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, both teaching kindergarten through eighth grade, and Christ the King High School, which has a strong basketball team.\\nTHE HISTORY\\nThe cemeteries have been a mainstay since the 19th century, when the Catholic and Lutheran churches bought farmland. In 1915, Juniper Swamp was filled in to become Juniper Valley Park. The area has also had Mafia connections: Anthony Aiello and Vincent Ganci both lived here; John Gotti and Lucky Luciano are buried at St. John\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Cemetery.\\n', '', '', 'MODELED on the protests and celebrations that erupt on the National Mall, Jean Shin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s latest installation \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a roiling, shoulder-to-shoulder crowd in miniature \\xe2\\x80\\x94 will carpet a 45-foot-long rectangular space at the Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington beginning May 1. The figures will be gleaming trophies, stripped of their sports paraphernalia and refashioned with new props into janitors, cashiers, mailmen and other unsung laborers, now pushing their strollers or swinging their hammers in exalted form.\\nMs. Shin, who was commissioned by the museum to create the installation, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cEveryday Monuments,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as part of her exhibition \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCommon Threads,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was inspired by Washington as a city planned around its heroic monuments. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI thought of these trophies as a way to bring the monumentality to a more intimate level,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Ms. Shin, 37, an artist known for her vast accumulations of singular castoff objects \\xe2\\x80\\x94 old clothing, empty prescription bottles, losing lottery tickets \\xe2\\x80\\x94 which she transforms into arresting installations that loosely reflect the people who once used the items.\\nFor \\xe2\\x80\\x9cEveryday Monuments,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d which will be on view through July 26, she gathered donations of more than 2,000 trophies with the help of the Smithsonian and local donors who included parents of students at Walt Whitman High School in Bethesda, Md., which she attended after her family moved from South Korea when she was 6. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe trophies can have a second life and be updated to represent all the people who maybe never won trophies or decided not to be sports stars but live their lives through work,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said.\\nWhen Ms. Shin first conceived of the piece a couple of years ago, she was thinking of grand moments on the National Mall like the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.\\xe2\\x80\\x99s historic speech there and the Million Man March, but she could never have foreseen the flooding of people into the space for President Obama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s inauguration. Joanna Marsh, curator of the exhibition, considers it serendipity.  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was wonderful to see that actualized just as the piece was coming together, and it will be so fresh in people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s minds when they see the work,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said, adding that the exhibition will also include seven other large-scale installations Ms. Shin has created since 2000.\\nOn a recent morning at her small studio in Brooklyn, filled with a team of assistants meticulously attaching tiny cast mops, paint rollers, cash registers and computers to hundreds of trophies, Ms. Shin described watching her parents, who had both been professors in Seoul, struggle with discrimination and menial jobs when they moved to the Washington area, where they eventually owned a supermarket and liquor store. For a child the adjustment was easier. In high school she was encouraged to pursue painting seriously, and in her senior year in 1990 she entered the national Presidential Scholars in the Arts competition and won a full scholarship to the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, her own trophy of sorts.\\nAfter receiving her B.F.A. in painting in 1994, she went on at Pratt to get a master\\xe2\\x80\\x99s degree in art history and criticism and then took a day job at the Whitney Museum as a curatorial assistant. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy studio practice really shifted by studying art history and criticism,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Ms. Shin, who began questioning her reasons for making figurative painting and struggled to find a new direction and choice of materials.\\nOne day it occurred to the petite Ms. Shin as she was organizing her cluttered Williamsburg apartment that all the cuffs of fabric that she had trimmed from the bottom of her pants were the same size. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t fit fashion\\xe2\\x80\\x99s standard by exactly two-and-a-half inches,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFashion is so much about these ideals. I began to think about how using the leftover pant legs could be personal and physical as well as speak to our collective desires.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nShe canvassed alterations shops and found people who agreed to save their pant-leg scraps for her. Gathering hundreds of these cylindrical forms, Ms. Shin dipped them in wax to make them stiff. Then, for a group show at Gen Art in New York in 1998, she installed a roughly 12-by-12-foot cityscape of cuffs across the floor, suggesting a population that didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t measure up. Called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAlterations\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and purchased by the collector Peter Norton, the piece also alluded to the largely Asian immigrant work force that does most of the tailoring jobs in New York.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s become a really important part of my work,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said of the community collaboration required for \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAlterations,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgoing up to total strangers and somehow implicating myself in the objects of their lives. Any material I get is the beginning of a conversation and a relationship.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nMs. Shin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s earlier work was defined by her use of clothing as surrogates for people. But since 2004, when she had her first solo show, at the Frederieke Taylor Gallery in New York, Ms. Shin has branched out more to nonfabric materials that still have a physical relationship to the body. For \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTEXTile,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d made in 2006 in collaboration with the Fabric Workshop and Museum in Philadelphia, she took apart old computer keyboards to illuminate how these objects, touched by rote with our fingertips, project our thoughts out into the world. More than 22,000 key caps, spelling out all the e-mail messages between the artist and the Fabric Workshop about the making of the artwork, were embedded into a 20-foot-long fabric scroll.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cChemical Balance,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d also part of the Smithsonian show, alludes to how we change the chemistry of our bodies through prescription drugs. Ms. Shin gathered empty orange pill bottles and assembled them into towering arrangements that appear to grow out of the floor or dangle from the ceiling. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAny organic structure that we see in nature bonds together and then falls apart for its own purposes of growth and decay,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Ms. Shin, who is interested in mirroring society\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dependence on these drugs.\\nShe has very particular criteria for the salvaged materials she uses in her work: that something is \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccast off from a person\\xe2\\x80\\x99s life because its desirability and usefulness are questioned, that it in some way archives a personal history but also can speak to larger issues going on in our culture.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd then,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she added, \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccan I deconstruct it and make it new?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nHer recently completed mosaic, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCeladon Remnants,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d commissioned by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Arts for Transit program and installed along the outdoor stairwell of a Long Island Rail Road station in a densely populated Korean-American community in Queens, was inspired by the elegance and fragility of celadon pottery commonly found in Korean homes. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a celebrated moment in history when Koreans perfected this ceramic that people take lots of pride in,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said.\\nFor the project Ms. Shin traveled to Icheon, just outside Seoul, and persuaded the government to donate a vast landscape of broken pottery from outside one of the major kilns.\\nShe then used her budget for materials to ship the three tons of shards back to the United States, where she worked with a fabricator to reconstitute the fragments into large, partial silhouettes showing just enough of the curves to suggest vases but also evoking the abstract shapes of Ellsworth Kelly. Literally and metaphorically she reunited something broken in Korea in a new form in America.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFor me,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe greater only happens by the accumulation of many, one piece at a time.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n', 'MODIIN ILLIT, West Bank \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Seen from afar, this fast-growing settlement embodies everything that the Obama administration wants to address through its demand for a freeze on settlement building: it sits on land captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war and, with 45,000 residents and 60 births a week, it is the largest and fastest-growing Jewish community in the West Bank.\\nIf, as is widely believed abroad, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnatural growth\\xe2\\x80\\x9d by Israeli settlers is blocking the creation of a viable Palestinian state, this community should show why.\\nBut appearances are deceiving. Modiin Illit and its sister community, Beitar Illit, are entirely ultra-Orthodox, a world apart, one of strict religious observance and study. They offer surprising potential for compromise.\\nUnlike settlers who believe they are continuing the historic Zionist mission of reclaiming the Jewish homeland, most ultra-Orthodox do not consider themselves settlers or Zionists and express no commitment to being in the West Bank, so their growth in these settlement towns, situated just inside the pre-1967 boundary, could be redirected westward to within Israel.\\nTheir location also means it may be possible, in negotiations about a future Palestinian state, to redraw the boundary so the settlements are inside Israel, with little land lost to the Palestinians. And the two towns alone account for half of all settler growth, so if removed from the equation, the larger settler challenge takes on more manageable proportions.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf I thought this was a settlement, I would never have come here,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Yaakov Guterman, 40, the mayor of Modiin Illit and a grandfather of three, his Orthodox fringes hanging from his belt, his side locks curled behind his ears. Asked about the prospect of a Palestinian state rising one day on his town line, he said: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe will go along with what the world wants. We have gone through the Holocaust and know what it means to have the world against us. The Torah says a man needs to know his place.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nWhether or not Mr. Guterman will be as pliant as he says, Middle East peace negotiators on all sides \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Israeli, Palestinian and American \\xe2\\x80\\x94 have long viewed small border adjustments and land swaps as key to a deal that would include a solution to the hundreds of thousands of Jews who have settled in the West Bank over the past four decades.\\nThis week, three senior American officials will be in Jerusalem for talks that will include settlements:  the Middle East envoy, George J. Mitchell; the White House Middle East adviser, Dennis Ross; and the national security adviser, Gen. James Jones. Secretary of Defense Robert  M. Gates will also be in talks in Jerusalem.\\nBreak With Settler Movement  \\nThe ultra-Orthodox inhabitants often express contempt for the settler movement, with its vows never to move. The people here, who shun most aspects of modernity, came for three reasons: they needed affordable housing no longer available in and around Jerusalem or Tel Aviv; they were rejected by other Israeli cities as too cult-like; and officials wanted their presence to broaden Israel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s narrow border.\\nYet they are lumped with everyone else. The settler movement  and the Israeli government point to ultra-Orthodox settlements, with their large and ever-increasing families, to argue that there is no way to stop \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnatural growth\\xe2\\x80\\x9d without imposing acute human suffering. Those seeking a freeze use the settlements as evidence that growth is so out of control that drastic action must be taken. More broadly, opponents say the settlements violate international law, legitimize force by armed messianic Jews and ruin the chance of establishing a viable Palestinian state.\\nBut even those who strongly favor a complete freeze acknowledge that the annual settler growth rates of 5 and 6 percent owe a great deal to these two towns that have little to do with the broader settler enterprise.\\nDror Etkes of Yesh Din, an antisettlement group in Israel, noted that half of all construction in West Bank settlements was taking place in these two ultra-Orthodox communities, adding that given their location next to the boundary, it was highly likely they would be in Israel in a future deal through a redrawn border. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFrom a purely geographic point of view, construction there is not as destructive as elsewhere,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said.\\nBut he  does not want building to continue in Modiin Illit or Beitar Illit without a deal for a Palestinian state, nor does he mean to imply that these settlements have been a benign force. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLand has been taken from Palestinians, in some cases from private landowners, for the building in these settlements, and there are many other issues like sewage flow into Palestinian villages that must be addressed,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Etkes said.\\nSettler leaders reject any distinction. The fact that the ultra-Orthodox came to the West Bank to solve their housing problems is \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccompletely O.K. with me,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Dani Dayan, chairman of the Yesha Council, the settlers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 political umbrella group. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey are an integral part of our endeavor and our achievement.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n The Palestinian View \\nBut even in Bilin, the Palestinian village that abuts Modiin Illit and has become a symbol of Palestinian resistance against Israel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s West Bank separation barrier, the settlers over the fence are viewed as different from the Jewish nationalists in, say, Hebron.\\nAbedallah Abu Rahma, a teacher from a farming family and a leading activist in the village, pointed toward the settler high-rise buildings visible across the valley from his living room window and said: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey tell us, \\xe2\\x80\\x98We are poor, the apartments here are cheaper and we did not know it was a settlement.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Many told us, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Give us our money back and we will leave.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xc2\\xa0\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nThe Palestinians, who hold weekly demonstrations against the barrier, have even joined forces with some of the settlers. Two years ago, Bilin won a major Supreme Court case  that forced a change in the route of the barrier, and some of the documents the victorious villagers used, Mr. Abu Rahma said, had been secretly passed to them by ultra-Orthodox settlers feuding with their own municipal leaders.\\nStill, none of that lessens the harm to the villagers caused by the very existence of Modiin Illit and the contest over its land. Mr. Abu Rahma said he would respect any agreement reached between the Palestinian leadership and Israel, including one that had  Modiin Illit standing in Israel. But noting the village\\xe2\\x80\\x99s reliance on agriculture, its own housing needs and the settlement\\xe2\\x80\\x99s encroachment on Bilin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s territory, he insisted, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe need our land.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nMoreover, protecting the settlements from attack has meant construction of numerous barriers, checkpoints and bypass roads that impair economic development and disrupt daily life.\\nAcross the West Bank and excluding East Jerusalem, there are nearly 300,000 settlers living on scores of settlements among 2.3 million Palestinians. And while some say they will fight to stay put, a third are the reluctant ultra-Orthodox, known in Israel as Haredim, Hebrew for the fearful ones, or those who tremble in awe of God.\\nThey believe it important to live in the land of Israel, because certain commandments can be performed only here. But some Haredim actively reject the formation of a Jewish state before the arrival of the Messiah, while others are ambivalent. They also say that protecting life trumps holding territory. Very few serve in the military because the ultra-Orthodox say they do more good for the nation by studying the Torah and praying than fighting.\\nUntil his death in 2001, Rabbi Eliezer Schach  was the religious authority of the  Haredim of European origin. He opposed building Jewish settlements that extended over the 1967 line into territory Israel seized in the war, once calling them \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca blatant attempt to provoke the international community\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and complaining that they endangered Jewish lives. In fact, when first offered housing for his followers in Beitar Illit, he took it as an insult, according to Yitzchak Pindrus, a former mayor of the settlement.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOur people live around their families and rabbis, and they were terrified of the idea,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Pindrus recalled. But with thousands of new couples marrying every year, and the traditional ultra-Orthodox communities expensive and crowded, the Haredim needed homes.\\nBecause few ultra-Orthodox men work, because on average their families have eight children and because they do not integrate easily into the larger community, Teddy Kollek, who was  mayor of Jerusalem in the late 1980s, wanted to keep down their numbers. Other cities rejected them. Yitzhak Rabin,  as both defense minister and then prime minister,  championed the creation of large settlements around Jerusalem to fortify Israel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hold on the capital, in line with his Labor Party\\xe2\\x80\\x99s strategic plan, so he and the Haredim struck a deal for Beitar Illit in the early 1990s.\\nFor those wanting to remain closer to longstanding Haredi communities in the center of the country, Modiin Illit was an alternative. Private Israeli developers bought tracts of Palestinian land  as its base, although the legitimacy of those sales has been challenged. Mr. Guterman, the mayor,  said Mr. Rabin \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgave his blessing to the city,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d telling Rabbi Schach\\xe2\\x80\\x99s disciples that its strategic location on the first rise above Israel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s international airport guaranteed that it would not be given back.\\nThere are smaller pockets of Haredi settlement deeper in the West Bank, where the arm\\xe2\\x80\\x99s-length attitude toward Zionist settlement has shifted toward a more distinctly right-wing ideology. Zvi Kastelanitz, of the Immanuel settlement, who produces silver-inlaid Jewish handicrafts, for example, said he had no objection to two states for two peoples, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut not here.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Still, the Haredi settlers even there remain distinct. After Palestinians ambushed two buses on the road to Immanuel, southwest of Nablus, in 2001 and 2002, killing a total of 20 people, the Haredi settlers did not react like their nationalist counterparts, defiantly setting up another settlement outpost. Instead, about a third of Immanuel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 4,000 residents left.\\nShunning Secular World \\nThe Haredi world is all about being together and apart from secular temptations, an intricate patchwork of groups with allegiances to different rabbinic dynasties and courts. In the new cities, Haredi rules apply. At the entrance to Beitar Illit, a sign warns visitors to dress modestly. The streets are all named for rabbis and sages from Poland to Yemen. There is Internet access, officially intended for professional use only. Televisions are allowed, but nobody admits to having one. And there is poverty: about 40 percent of wives support their large families because their husbands do not work. There are few cars, lots of buses and baby strollers.\\nDov Fromowitz, a father of nine who moved  to Beitar Illit from the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn 12 years ago, runs a central charity fund that collects money from better-off residents and distributes it to the poor, while connecting them with other social welfare services outside the settlement. He says he has 1,200 needy families on his books.\\nWithout most Israelis noticing, Modiin Illit and Beitar Illit have turned into the Haredi towns of the future, cleaner and saner versions of their often decrepit and densely packed neighborhoods elsewhere. They contain open space, even some greenery, and apartments with lots of bedrooms. Their young are shielded from secular Israel, and secular Israelis never see them, thereby reducing the tensions found in Jerusalem over driving on the Sabbath and sexy advertising at bus stops.\\nThe Question of Coexistence \\nEven if the ultra-Orthodox appear to be less ideologically committed to the West Bank, the longer they live here, the more invested some have become.\\nIn Modiin Illit, Mayor Guterman has ambitions to build what he calls \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe largest Haredi residential community in Israel.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Over the past three years, he has set up a business center that he considers the wave of the future. Now 1,000 women, mostly mothers in their 20s, sit at work stations providing phone services to Israeli credit card clients and paralegal research for real estate businesses in the United States. It is outsourcing that seeks to take advantage of the educational level and work ethic of Haredi women.\\nThe question of coexistence with Palestinians hovers, however. In Beitar Illit, farmers from the village of Husan enter daily in cars and on donkeys to work their lands in the valleys among the settlements\\xe2\\x80\\x99 built-up hills. The new mayor, Meir Rubinstein, is proud of the city\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cooperation with local Palestinians, whom he calls \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe neighbors.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe very much want there to be peace here,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe pray for it three times a day.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d But the question of peace at what price remains.\\nAvraham and Riva Guttman, who arrived in Beitar Illit 15 years ago from Toronto and have seven children, look out from their street at Palestinian villages. They believe strongly in living in the land of Israel, they say, and they are happy for the parks and space lacking in traditional Haredi areas of Israel. But they do not insist that it is there or nothing. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe are not here for political reasons,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Guttman said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNinety percent of the people are here for the affordability, not for ideology. Haredim don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t fight with Arabs.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nPerhaps not, but his wife, Riva, bristled at the idea of moving. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you told me to move elsewhere because Arabs needed a place to live, it would not sit quietly on my conscience,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am a Jew in the Jewish homeland.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nAnd increasingly, the Haredim have vested interests over the 1967 line. Yaron and Sara Simchovitch arrived in Beitar Illit from Jerusalem 13 years ago with a group led by their rabbi. The couple now have a thriving butcher shop.\\nYoseph Shilhav, an expert on the ultra-Orthodox at Bar-Ilan University, said that almost every Haredi family now had a member beyond the 1967 border, subtly shifting their attitudes about  settlement and withdrawal. The Haredim make up 10 percent of Israel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s population and are a fast-growing electoral force. The Chabad movement and Sephardic or Middle Eastern-origin Shas party have increasingly adopted the nationalist agenda.\\nThe rocket fire into Israel that resulted after its withdrawal from Gaza in 2005 has also taken its toll on Haredi views. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn general, Haredim are very practical people,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Pindrus, the former Beitar Illit mayor. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe are not right or left. If we get up in the morning and see that leaving Gaza means missiles, then no, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not leaving another centimeter.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He added, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe want to live, and our children not to blow up.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nStill, a surprising number do not oppose the establishment of a Palestinian state if safety can be guaranteed. Since housing is the No. 1 Haredi concern and they feel no need for it to be in the West Bank, redirecting the building of their new homes inside Israel could go a long way toward a solution.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf the Americans can convince us there will really be peace and we won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be living in fear of rockets, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll bring a recommendation to our rabbis,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Guterman, the mayor of Modiin Illit. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOur rabbis want peace. We are not against withdrawing from territory. But life is above all.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n', 'NEW YORK used to be  a second-string city when it came to coffee. No longer.\\nOver the last two years, more than 40 new cafes and coffee bars have joined a small, dedicated group of establishments where coffee making is treated like an art, or at least a high form of craft.\\nAt places like Bluebird Coffee Shop in the East Village, the espresso is so plush and bright that it tastes sweet on its own.\\nThe elaborate designs in the cappuccino\\xe2\\x80\\x99s foam at Third Rail Coffee in the West Village aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t just to show off, but are a sign that the barista properly steamed the milk so that it holds its form.\\nAt Abra\\xc3\\xa7o in the East Village, you can get drip coffee brewed by the cup, not drawn from an urn.\\nFor years New Yorkers had to look to places like Stumptown Coffee Roasters in Portland, Ore., or Blue Bottle Coffee in San Francisco for this kind of quality. Now both companies have opened roasters and coffee bars in New York. Four Barrel Coffee of San Francisco will be roasting here soon.\\nMeanwhile, some established cafes around the city have made moves toward roasting their own beans. Caf\\xc3\\xa9 Grumpy is already doing it, and Abra\\xc3\\xa7o will by the summer.\\nThis means that New Yorkers can now drink coffee that is made from some of the best beans available in the United States, freshly roasted in town.\\nThe difference between a cup of coffee from these new style coffee bars and what was available before is striking.\\nThese shops use only beans that have been roasted in the past 10 days (though some say two weeks is fine), so the flavors are still lively.\\nThe beans are ground to order for each cup. Certain coffee bars have a skyline of grinders: one for espresso, one for decaffeinated espresso, one for brewed coffee. If they offer more than one variety of espresso bean, that gets its own grinder, too.\\nMilk is steamed to order for each macchiato or latte. A telltale sign is an arsenal of smaller steam pitchers, instead of one big one.\\nAnd coffee bars reaching for the highest rung use only manual espresso machines run by baristas who, in the past three years, have been able to attend classes given by the leading roasting companies in the intricacies of these devices. Many chain stores are turning to automatic machines with preset levels for coffee, temperature and timing.\\nFor brewed coffee, there are French press pots, filter cones or machines like the Clover or Bunn\\xe2\\x80\\x99s new Trifecta.\\nSome of the obsessiveness may get a bit off-putting.

Want a cappuccino made from single-origin beans at Kaffe 1668? Sorry, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be told, but milk would overpower the subtle flavors of the coffee. Wonder why the barista pulled and tossed out two shots of espresso before she served you yours? She was making sure it was perfect, the coffee evenly tamped, the water temperature ideal for the particular beans, the timing just right. (The best baristas will \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdial in\\xe2\\x80\\x9d throughout the day, tasting the espresso and adjusting the grind and dose.)\\nWant a double espresso? You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll have to buy two singles.\\nToday, most of the chains use about seven grams of ground coffee for a two-ounce shot. Espresso pods are filled with around five grams.\\nBaristas at the best places in town, like Bluebird Coffee Shop or Joe, tamp down between 19 and 21 grams. Often the espresso is even more concentrated because it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pulled \\xe2\\x80\\x9cshort,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d with less water, so that the final volume is a thick 1.5 to 2 ounces.\\nWith that much coffee \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and care \\xe2\\x80\\x94  put into each shot, baristas feel that a larger shot, with more water, would compromise the quality of the espresso.\\nThis awakening has led some unlikely businesses to offer serious, artful drinks.

Mr. Fortuna works for Google as a senior software engineer. Ms. Fortuna, a civil engineer, is employed by a consulting firm that is helping to renovate the 107-year-old Williamsburg Bridge.\\nBut finding a place to live in a big and sometimes unforgiving city proved daunting. Knowing little about New York and having few friends to whom they could turn for guidance, the Fortunas ended up in a prewar building on the Upper West Side in a studio that had been reconfigured as a cramped one-bedroom apartment.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was also a fourth-floor walk-up,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Ms. Fortuna recalled. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut the worst thing was that the building turned out to be infested with bedbugs. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d see them crawling on the mailboxes when I walked in the front door.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nThe fridge was so old that when the light burned out, replacement bulbs were no longer available. Trucks barreling down Columbus Avenue jolted the Fortunas awake at 5 in the morning. Occasionally they looked at other apartments, but with little success.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know anyone in the city who could give us advice,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Ms. Fortuna said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd that made it hard.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nOne day the following summer, the couple took the tram to Roosevelt Island, just to admire the view. They barely set foot on the island; they turned right around and went back to Manhattan. But the casual outing introduced them to a corner of the city that would ultimately offer an apartment and a community in which they would feel utterly at home. After their lease on the Upper West Side ran out, Roosevelt Island was their next stop.\\nThe couple\\xe2\\x80\\x99s first toehold there was an apartment in a newish high-rise. It was also a 10-minute walk from the island\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lone subway stop. Finding the bus service erratic, they traveled to and from the subway by bike, but  that proved less fun as winter approached and even worse when it rained. Still, they savored the pace and friendliness of island life.\\nThey especially relished the walkway that runs along the island\\xe2\\x80\\x99s western rim, a popular route along which strollers and bench sitters could admire the Manhattan skyline while perched beside the water.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou see the same people day after day,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Ms. Fortuna said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey say hi. You say hello. It felt really good. We didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know many people in New York. But thanks partly to this street, we got to know people here.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nTwo years after they settled on the island and now both 29, they lucked out further when a two-bedroom condominium became available in Riverwalk Court, a brand-new high-rise just steps from the subway. The condo\\xe2\\x80\\x99s owner had been buffeted by the recession, and even before he moved in,  decided to sublet the apartment and live somewhere cheaper elsewhere on the island.\\nThe Fortunas, who arrived last February and pay $3,100 a month, are the apartment\\xe2\\x80\\x99s first residents. Everything was so new, they could  smell the varnish on the hardwood floors. The chalk-white walls were so pristine, the couple were at first reluctant to hang pictures.\\nAlthough modest in size, the apartment radiates traces of the glamour associated with those pieds-\\xc3\\xa0-terre familiar from 1940s movies set in the more luxurious precincts of Manhattan \\xe2\\x80\\x94 \\xe2\\x80\\x9call windows and filled with light,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as a friend described the place.\\nIn the living room, floor-to-ceiling windows open onto views of the East River, the 59th Street Bridge, the Manhattan skyline and the seemingly endless expanse of Queens. Barges drifting along the river offer an endlessly shifting vista. Even the hulking power plant over in Astoria appears  picturesque. Looking down, the couple can see the grassy field where Mr. Fortuna plays soccer and softball on weekends.\\nThe views are nearly as dazzling in the bedroom, where the bridge seems so close, you feel as if you could reach out and touch one of its girders. Especially for a woman whose workdays focus on the rehabilitation of one of the city\\xe2\\x80\\x99s famous bridges, these vistas seem singularly appropriate.\\nThe furnishings, among them the spare black dining table, the gray and white sofa in the living room and the multicolored pillows heaped on the sofa bed in the second bedroom, came largely by way of Ikea.

The slow start to the race, with top runners going slower than 5 minutes in the first few miles, played to Gebremariam\\xe2\\x80\\x99s strengths. Had someone pushed an early pace, or made an earlier move, Gebremariam would have had to decide when to start expending the energy he would need at the end.

Dathan Ritzenhein finished eighth in 2:12.33.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x94 Lynn Zinser\\nGebre Gebremariam, a 26-year-old from Addis Ababa, Ethiopia is again making himself at home in Central Park. On his last trip here, he out-kicked the field to win the Healthy Kidney 10K here earlier this year. Now, he left Emmanuel Mutai of Kenya in the dust in the final mile to win the New York City Marathon.\\nHe won in 2 hours, 8.13 minutes.\\nMutai, also 26, but a marathon veteran, finished second.\\nMutai finished second in the London Marathon last spring. Gebremariam prepared for this by finishing second in the Philadelphia Half-Marathon this summer.\\nHe is the fourth man to win this race in his marathon debut.\\nGebremariam unleashed the finishing kick at Mile 25 and began pulling away from a suddenly struggling Mutai. Gebremariam, making his marathon debut here, is running easily and looks very strong. \\n\\xe2\\x80\\x94 Lynn Zinser\\nGebremariam and Mutai are in Central Park alone, having dropped Kwambai for the final time. He was 20 seconds behind as the top two are neck-and-neck in the final hills at Mile 24. This will be a great finish.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x94 Lynn Zinser\\nEdna Kiplagat of Kenya used a strong push through the hills of Central Park to leave her nearest competitors behind far behind as the finish line neared.\\nShe won in 2:28.20. \\nKiplagat, 31, has had a phenomenal year. She won her first three races of 2010, including the Los Angeles Marathon, all in personal best times. The other was a 15K in Utica, N.Y. and the Steamboat (Ill.) Classic 4-Mile.\\nFlanagan caught Keitani in the hills of the final mile and finished second in 2:28.40.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x94 Lynn Zinser\\nIt appeared Gebremariam and Mutai had turned the men\\xe2\\x80\\x99s race to a two-man contest, but Kwambai has not given up. He is only a few meters back. From appearances, though, Gebremariam looks to be running the easiest at Mile 23. He is the 2009 world cross-country champion and he is known for his finishing speed.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x94 Lynn Zinser\\nGebre Gebremariam, of Ethiopia, leading the race with Mutai, is only one half of the debut duo from Ethiopia. His wife, Werknesh Kidane was supposed to make her marathon debut, but pulled out with a calf injury this week. She stayed home in Ethiopia with their two sons.\\n\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x9cShe told me to win for her,\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x9d Gebremariam said.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x94 Liz Robbins\\nEdna Kiplagat is looking like the experienced marathoner she is, using her strength to pull ahead of Keitany and Flanagan, who has dropped to a distant third. She is only lengthening her lead as the finish line nears.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x94 Lynn Zinser\\nIn Central Park, Edna Kiplagat began pushing the pace and Keitany went with her, but Flanagan fell off their pace and is now desperately trying to catch up again.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x94 Lynn Zinser\\nThe men\\xe2\\x80\\x99s race continued to string out, with Gebre Gebremariam of Ethiopia battling out front with Emmanuel Mutai of Kenya. It pits two of the world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s best marathoning countries. Not unexpected on that front, but most thought Gebrselassie would be the Ethiopian contending for the title.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x94 Lynn Zinser\\nMary Keitany of Kenya is the world champion at the half-marathon and Shalane Flanagan of the United States is the reigning bronze medalist in the Olympic 10,000 meters but that hardly means they would win their first marathon \\xe2\\x80\\x94 but both have an excellent chance.\\nAbout to enter Central Park past the 21-mile mark, Keitany and Flanagan were in the lead pack of three with Edna Kiplagat of Kenya, the one of the three with marathon experience. She won the Los Angeles Marathon earlier this year.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x94 Lynn Zinser\\nIt has been since 2007 that a man from Kenya has won the New York City Marathon. But this has been quite a fall for the running-rich nation.\\nHow about this astounding statistic of dominance? Race Results Weekly helped tracked 45 fall marathons with international fields since Sept. 5. and found that men from Kenya have won 40 of them, and Ethiopian men have won the other five.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x94 Liz Robbins\\nI walked out my building in Fort Greene this morning and saw small knots of people running down the sidewalk. Some were pushing strollers, some were dragging small dogs in their wake.\\nThere was no real rush \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the New York City marathon was already well underway and it would be hours before the final stragglers made their way down Lafayette Avenue and the neighborhood would return to normal. But watching my neighbors rush down the street, I couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t help but feel that I needed to run, too.  There was the unmistakable feeling that we were missing something.\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been said before, but Marathon Sunday is the day New Yorkers put away their stranger faces, the ones that allow them to function every day in packed subways and elevators and movie theaters. They make signs for people they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve never met, plan elaborate playlists to blare out their windows, and drop any aloof pretense.\\nOnce I arrived at Lafayette, I noticed that a band had set up outside the deli where I usually pick up milk. A few blocks down, someone had set up loudspeakers and was blaring everything from Born to Run to Footloose. People were cheering, but they were also all-out dancing \\xe2\\x80\\x94 shaking their hips and shouting out the lyrics to Billy Idol\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMony Mony.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nOnce the elite athletes passed through \\xe2\\x80\\x94 they flashed by in a blur of police motorcycles and press trucks \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the runners joined the party. One was dressed in a Minnie Mouse outfit. Another wore a full-length, hot-pink bodysuit. One ran by sipping a can of beer.\\nAcross the street, I noticed a woman and her son passing out cookies from an aluminum tin. The spectators smiled, as touched as I was by this small-town display of neighborliness. But not a single person took a cookie.\\nThis is New York, after all.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x93Katie Thomas\\nFirst Avenue is the great separator, the downhill of Manhattan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Upper East Side, and the crowd\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wild cheering, combining to spur the runners to go even faster than some might be able to handle.\\nJames Kwambai, of Kenya, sprinted just steps ahead of Mutai, of Kenya, Bouramdane, of Morocco, and Gebre Gebramariam, of Ethiopia. They ran a 4:26 17th mile.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x94 Liz Robbins\\nAt Mile 21, the women\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pack is down to eight, with Shalane Flanagan still in there sharing the front of that pack with Mary Keitany of Kenya \\nBy Saturday night, the buzz began among the men\\xe2\\x80\\x99s professional field that Gebrselassie\\xe2\\x80\\x99s knee was not in good shape. He was getting it worked on, two coaches noted, but whether that was strategy or reality was yet unclear. Gebrselassie made it clear on his Twitter feed right before the race, and despite his staying in the lead pack for the first 15 miles, the pain, apparently was too intense before he even made it to Manhattan.\\nNew York Road Runners officials said Gebrselassie underwent an MRI on Saturday night and there was fluid found on his knee.\\nThis is the second straight race in New York that Gebrselassie withdrew mid-race. At the half-marathon in March, he pulled up with asthma problems.\\nEven before he started on Sunday, Gebrselassie had committed to running the Tokyo Marathon in February. \\n\\xe2\\x80\\x93Liz Robbins\\nThe lead pack not only lost Haile Gebrselassie, who dropped out before the 17-mile mark, but defending champion Meb Keflezighi fell off the pace as the lead pack began to string out along First Avenue in Manhattan. \\nThere are four men at the very front: Mutai, Gebre, Kwambai and Bouramdane. \\nJust a women\\xe2\\x80\\x99s note: earlier this week, Shalane Flanagan said she thought that a 2:25 would win the race and she had been training around that pace. But she was cautious about her own chances, saying she just wanted to make the podium in her marathon debut. In Mile 19, Flanagan took the lead and the pace is in her favor, heading towards a 2:30 finish.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x94 Liz Robbins\\nWomen\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x99s wheelchair winner Tatyana McFadden gained national attention when she led a move to pass the Fitness and Athletics Equity for Students with Disabilities Act, which the Maryland state legislature passed in 2008. Before the law was passed, McFadden was forced to compete by herself at Atholton High School (Maryland) track and field meets. The law ensures that students with disabilities have equal opportunities to participate in physical education and athletic programs, and allowed her to compete in the same events on the track at the same time along with able-bodied athletes.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x93Dave Ungrady\\nGebrselassie just stopped running, as he was charging downward on the Queensboro Bridge. He was favoring his knee, started slowing and then pulled up in the 16th mile. This is a stunning development, albeit one he, himself, might have predicted. \\n\\xe2\\x80\\x93Liz Robbins\\nOn the Queensboro Bridge, world record holder Haile Gebrselassie pulled up and stopped.\\nIf Shalane Flanagan is feeling uncomfortable in her first marathon or feeling any pressure as the lead American star here, she is not showing it. Near the 30 K mark, Flanagan is running with an easy stride and showing no signs of extraordinary effort or discomfort. \\nShe took the lead at the front of the lead pack, with others expending much more obvious effort, including Kim Smith of New Zealand, who was up front with Flanagan.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x93Lynn Zinser\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cnyseiler\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is in Long Island City and on Twitter, waiting for the elite men.

And after last year\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x99s victory in New York, a veritable lifetime achievement award, he deserves to soak up all of the accolades this week.\\nKeflezighi said that 12 of his family members are in town, including his parents and one of his brothers who took the red-eye flight from California just in time for the race.\\nWhile he admitted that another victory in New York (which would make him the first American man to repeat as champion since Alberto Salazar did it in 1982), would be \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe frosting on the cake,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he does not appear to be content with last year\\xe2\\x80\\x99s laurel crown.

Amid the surging, Gebrselassie stayed comfortably in the  middle of the lead pack. \\n\\xe2\\x80\\x93Liz Robbins\\nIf all goes as planned, Ron Hankins, 52, of Des Moines will see a familiar sight through each of the boroughs as he runs his ninth marathon: bright yellow ears of corn.\\nFifteen of his friends are in New York from Iowa to surprise him with foam helmets in the shape of corn that each will to wear on various points along the route.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe wore pink wigs in Boston, and he said it really gave him a boost,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Jackie Quinn, who was with the group on 92nd Street in Bay Ridge.

The pace is very slow, with no one like Paula Radcliffe (who is taking a maternity leave from the sport she has ruled) to force the issue. Defending champion Derartu Tulu is in the back of that pack, playing it cautiously along with everyone else.\\nAlso in that pack is American Shalane Flanagan, looking comfortable with the non-aggressive pace.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x93Lynn Zinser\\nGebrselassie  came off the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge tucked into the lead pack, having run a very slow opening mile \\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x93 5  minutes, 55 seconds.

Before he lined up, he gave a short television interview via translator when he was asked about the weather, but the first part, everybody understood:\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMucho frio, mucho frio,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said.\\nHe said his reception in New York has been overwhelming: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPeople here have been so nice to me and given me a warm welcome. People stop me on the street to say hello. Everybody has been fabulous.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nHe also said he was running not only for himself, but to inspire others to run a marathon: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI would like to inspire young children to run because running makes you free.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x93Lynn Zinser\\nAs the women\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x99s race is now underway, a reminder that the New York City Marathon serves as the 2010 USA Women\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x99s Marathon championships.\\nShalane Flanagan, the 2008 Olympic bronze medalist in the 10,000 meters who is making her marathon debut, is the marquee favorite, but her inexperience at the distance creates questions about how she will respond to the challenge. Katie MGregor, the 2005 U.S. outdoor 10,000 champion, has run two marathons, both here in New York, with a personal best 2:31:14 in 2008. She\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x99s finished in the top 10 in New York in both races.\\nLinda Somers Smith, 49, is a sentimental favorite.

Smith ran 2:36:33 and finished sixth at the Los Angeles Marathon earlier this year.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x93Dave Ungrady\\nHaile Gebrselassie, the world-record holder, he announced before the race.

At one end are the fun and highly focused sites like Street Mattress (founded in 2001 and still posting pictures of discarded Posturepedics). At the other are more academically minded ruminations on refuse, like Discard Studies, started in August. Last Night\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Garbage occupies a space between these two poles. Photographs of trash dominate the blog and provide its author, Jed Tamarkin, with inspiration for writing short bits of fiction.\\nThe blog, which gets about 25,000 page views a month, has evolved since Mr. Tamarkin began shooting pictures outside his East Village apartment in the summer of 2007. Each photo was accompanied by text describing a fictional character with some relationship to whatever toy or commode or stroller happened to be lying on the street as Mr. Tamarkin passed by with his Canon point-and-shoot. (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a lot of baby strollers for some reason,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said.) Tags along the right side of the blog chronicle some of the recurring characters. There is Ross, a hard-drinking artist with relationship troubles; Stef, a chatty and celebrity-obsessed young woman; and Bobby, a drug-addled musician. There are also people who appeared only once, tossed off like so many old items of clothing. \\nMore recently, Mr. Tamarkin began pairing photographs with reposted bits of content to create \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca nudge and a rib\\xe2\\x80\\x9d about the wastefulness of consumer culture. In a post from July, an excerpt from a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCBS News\\xe2\\x80\\x9d article about a man who was fined for taking garbage off the street runs underneath a photograph of a destroyed air-conditioner. The juxtaposition is funny and seems to carry a subtle message: Not all trash is someone else\\xe2\\x80\\x99s treasure; most of it just ends up in the landfill.\\nBEHIND THE SCREEN \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI was on the first floor, and there was garbage accumulating everywhere,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Tamarkin, 31, an advertising art director, said of the apartment that provided early grist for the blog. His window faced a shaft at the rear of the building, where years of refuse had caked into the concrete. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI had crazy rat problems,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. (He now lives in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.)\\nHe started taking photographs simply to document the situation for the building\\xe2\\x80\\x99s management company, but pretty soon, he said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cit got me seeing trash in a new way, actually looking at it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The lines, forms and colors of an ordinary pile of garbage started to resemble sculpture, and the blog began as a kind of ode to what he came to see as the city\\xe2\\x80\\x99s accidental artists. Mr. Tamarkin attaches more than the usual sentimental value to things, which may account for his interest in recreating back stories for other people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s castoffs. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy wife, I think, would call me a pack rat,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said.\\nThough much of Last Night\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Garbage is from the East Village, Mr. Tamarkin carries his camera around with him, and lately has been posting about once a week. The neighborhoods where pictures are taken are not specified on the site, and appear to be beside the point. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis blog is based out of New York City,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut it could be anywhere.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nNew York Online periodically profiles blogs and Web sites made in New York City.

It crashed into the middle of Havemeyer Street, crushing a parked car, setting off alarms and blocking the street. A deafening chorus of horns rose outside Atlas\\xe2\\x80\\x99s window as traffic halted. An 18-wheeler executed a sketchy 10-point turn in the middle of a crowded intersection before a pair of fire trucks made their way through the traffic jam in a blaze of red. Chain saws roared, sawdust flew and the horns built to a  peak. It was New York urban pandemonium at its finest.\\nInside the warm confines of Atlas, separated from the chaos by only a thin wall of glass, not a soul stirred. A quiet mention was made of the falling tree, a few heads rose for a second, and then, just as quickly, they ducked back down. They all returned to whatever was on the other side of their glowing, partly eaten apples. On a day when the cafe Internet connection had already been down for four hours, and the toilet had been blocked for even longer, I thought I had seen these worker bees pushed to their limit. But I had underestimated them. Nothing could stir these people. They were not in New York; they were citizens of Laptopistan.\\nI was an interloper among them, an anthropologist of sorts, sent to untangle their odd society, to understand their mores and unwritten rules. How did the natives interact? How did the government function? What was the economy like in this land of bottomless cups and table hoggers? And what, oh what, were they all writing?\\nI was, admittedly, a profoundly skeptical observer. Though I had been a freelance writer for the last eight years, I had always worked at home, clad in pajamas and brewing my own fuel rather than paying $3 for someone to make pretty designs in my caffeinated foam. Whenever my wife suggested that I get out of the house, maybe take my laptop to a cafe, I shot back: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cReal freelancers don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t work in coffee shops. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just unemployed hipsters and their unpublished novels, or screenplays, or Facebook stati.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nMy disdain for the coffee shop writing scene only grew this June, when I met a friend at the Red Horse Cafe in Park Slope. I had previously been there only on weekends, when it was filled with couples sharing the Sunday paper and parents wiping brownie residue off their toddlers. That weekday afternoon it was a place transformed. Gone were the newspapers and the strollers. Laptops had colonized every flat surface. No one uttered a word; people just stared into screens, expressionless. It felt like that moment in a horror movie when the innocent couple stumbles into a house filled with hibernating zombies, and they listen, in terror, as the floorboard creaks.\\nMy friend and I ordered our coffee, and began to discuss whatever it was we were there to discuss. Within seconds of opening my mouth, I felt a change in the room. Eyes rose from their screens and landed on us \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the zombies were awake, and they weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t happy. One of them passed our table on the way to the washroom and let loose what can only be described as a snicker. We downed our coffee and beat a quick retreat. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTo hell with those laptop-wielding fundamentalists,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I said.\\nSo what was I doing in Laptopistan? I moved from New York to Toronto in September, but had come back to the city for a week and was sleeping on a friend\\xe2\\x80\\x99s couch. I needed a place to work. Someone suggested Atlas. I swallowed my skepticism and got my passport ready.\\nSET on the corner of Havemeyer and Grand Streets, and flooded with light from two walls of windows, Atlas Caf\\xc3\\xa9, which opened in 2003, looks like a combination of worn trattoria and late 1990s Seattle coffeehouse. The name reflects its wall-sized map of the world (there are also a mobile of hanging globes, and flourishes of d\\xc3\\xa9cor inspired by someone\\xe2\\x80\\x99s travel to the Far East). The soundtrack is a mix of old country and folk (Dylan, Willy, Cohen and Cash), classical, bebop and French ballads.\\nA makeshift milk station sits in the center of the 750-square-foot room. To the left is a long bar of dark stained rustic wood, where people order food and drink (proper espressos for $1.50, excellent panini, salads and deadly little chocolate-filled Italian doughnuts,  $3), as well as the windowless, orange washroom. There are three stools at the bar, and beside them a table of reclaimed timber pressed against a cozy window bench. According to two signs, this little corner, perhaps one-sixth of the cafe, is designated a laptop-free zone.\\nEverything beyond is Laptopistan: two rows of old church pews formed into an elongated L, each fronted by small wooden tables and chairs. Scattered along the pews are tattered blue tubular pillows, for lumbar support. Windows run along the walls, flooding the computer zone with natural light during the day, creating a fishbowl effect for those inside looking out, and for passers-by, who frequently stop and stare at the tableau.\\nEntering Laptopistan is a task in itself. The floor presents an obstacle course of power cables snaking their way around coffee cups, over chairs, and around table legs, eventually finding a home in one of two power strips that look as though they came from a Soviet coal refinery. Whenever a plug is inserted, the outlet sparks, and certain movements can cause all the plugs on a given strip to simultaneously eject.\\nA quick glance around shows I have brought my laptop, a month-old MacBook Pro, to its nesting ground. Diversity here means the odd white MacBook or old black PowerBook scattered amid the silver MacBook Pros. Throughout the week I will see only a handful of PCs, each looking sadly out of place, like they have arrived at a black-tie affair in a corduroy blazer.\\nI worked for a few hours, and quickly learned the principal laws of Laptopistan:\\nSilence Is Golden. There is no prohibition on talking, of course, but, as one Atlas regular of several years, Joelle Hann, explained, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s almost a code that people aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t going to talk loud.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d When people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s phones ring, they run outside as fast as possible to take the call.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf someone\\xe2\\x80\\x99s on Skype or having a conversation, people make an effort to chill out their conversations with looks,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Ms. Hann, a yoga teacher and a freelance journalist and textbook editor. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhen they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t stop, you can feel the tension.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Shushing conversations is equally verboten. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo one wants to be the librarian,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Ms. Hann added.\\nRespect Personal Space. While any open seat is technically available, it is forbidden to set up your computer on a table with a computer already on it; doubling up is allowed only when all tables are taken. At the same time, people bounce from table to table throughout the day, chasing the sun, the shade or their own feng shui.\\nMind Your Neighborhood. When you get up to take a call, get coffee or use the washroom, you need only to look at a neighbor, make eye contact, look back at your computer and nod. The deal is sealed without a word: You watch my MacBook and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll watch yours.\\nMOST Laptopistanis \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Laptopistanites? Laptopistanians? \\xe2\\x80\\x94 at Atlas are in their 20s, 30s or early 40s, split evenly between men and women. The dress is casual, with both sexes wearing T-shirts, sweaters and jeans, though a few women seem dressed for \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwork\\xe2\\x80\\x9d with button-down blouses, blazers, even a dress or two. Most Laptopistanis work alone, though occasionally I spotted a group collaborating at a corner table. Socially, Laptopistan is a conservative society; outward displays of emotion are frowned upon. Most people hide behind their screens.\\nAaron Tugendhaft is the exception. He appears at Atlas every morning for a few hours, tie askew, black coffee at his side, some heady-looking book in front of him. Mr. Tugendhaft, who is an adjunct professor of religion at New York University and the editor of a small custom press, is one of the only Atlas regulars I observed sans laptop.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve made friends with people because I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m the only guy without a computer,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he told me, quietly, one morning. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA book can be a conversation starter.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nMr. Tugendhaft has been coming to Atlas nearly every day for three and a half years, but there are many Laptopistanis he has never spoken to. (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSome of them are in the room right now,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he confided in a low voice, eyeing a woman in a jean jacket two tables over.) He has dated fellow Laptopistanis, but not anymore, preferring to keep romance out of the workplace. People tend to keep to themselves, he said, until something breaks the routine: an argument between lovers, news of a subway breakdown, or, most often, some sort of interaction around the power strips.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPower is power,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Tugendhaft said.\\nMallory Roberts, a longhaired freelance astrophysicist, said that he had met two girlfriends (now exes), and his current roommate, via power-strip negotiations. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThree months ago Courtney was looking for a plug and we got to talking,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said of the roommate, with whom he is now working on a documentary about a giant telescope in Puerto Rico. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt turns out we went to the same university, and she needed a place to stay.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a recognition here,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he added, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat people come to a cafe to not be alone.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nTHE cost of living in Laptopistan, at least for my personal intake of tea, bagels, sandwiches and salad, averaged $12 a day. Other cafes popular with freelancers charge for wireless Internet access and even table time, but the owners of the Atlas, Enrico Lorenzetti and Luca Tesconi, refuse to. Observing the gross daily consumption in Laptopistan, where people seem to nurse a cup of coffee and a cookie  for hours, I could not imagine how the two managed to stay in business. But they said the laptops were a stealth economic engine.\\nWhile the people behind the screens spent a paltry $6 to $10 per day, their true value is as a draw for more profitable takeout customers, Mr. Lorenzetti said. From the moment the door opens at 7 a.m. until it closes at 9 p.m., the place is buzzing, a productive society, visible from the street through wraparound windows. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPeople come in to buy food and coffee to go, because they see a full crowd,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey think \\xe2\\x80\\x98Hey, this place must be good if I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even get a table.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xc2\\xa0\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nMy long-held notion that Laptopistan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s citizens were just sitting around e-mailing other writers in other cafes around the world dissipated as I got to know the MacBook Pro owners around me. Sure, there were aspiring screenwriters, novelists and people updating Twitter, but there was also Gauri Nanda, a product designer from Detroit who created Clocky, the alarm clock on wheels that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s featured at the MoMA store and sold worldwide. There was Billy Schultz, a corporate human resources consultant crunching numbers for spreadsheets in PowerPoint and Excel (on a Lenovo PC, no less), and Meredith Sadin, working on her doctorate in American politics at Princeton.\\nLaptopistan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s is an entrepreneurial economy, driven by solitary thinkers. Aszure Barton, a choreographer from Alberta, was working with colleagues to prepare for her contemporary dance show called BUSK, which will debut Dec. 17 at the Jerome Robbins Theater. Robert Olinger runs a biotech startup that is getting silkworms to make spider silk at commercial scale, designs online education programs for the New York City Department of Education, and directs theater projects with Russian artists. In just a few days I met architects and event planners, database designers, classical musicians, film editors and app developers, every facet of the creative economy working under one roof, not so much together as in tandem.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHere, people have large ambitions,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Olinger said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSome have resources, some don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. They don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have career plans mapped out, but they have a career in mind. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not looking at a particular ladder to climb, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re looking at a mountain to conquer.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nWHEN that tree fell that Wednesday afternoon, I was one of the only people who walked over to check it out. I knew I was becoming one of them when a voice in my head said: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cO.K., time to get back to work.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nAt home, the slightest change in light is enough of an excuse to get up, walk around, clip my nails or head into the kitchen. Though home offices seem like the perfect work environment, their unrestricted silence, uninterrupted solitude and creature comforts breed distraction. In Laptopistan, I focused with intense precision, sitting motionless for hours at a time. At home, when the Internet goes down, I feel professionally castrated, and usually retire to the sofa until the connection is restored. When the wireless network at Atlas seized up two afternoons in a row, I just switched to off-line tasks without breaking stride. No one else seemed fazed, either. If anything, the place got more crowded. Laptopistan provides structure, and freelancers, like children, secretly crave structure. You come to work, for two or four or eight hours, and you take comfort in the knowledge that everyone else is there to work as well. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a silent social pressure to it all.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt almost sounds sick,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Selena Ross, a fellow Canadian freelance journalist I sat next to one day, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut the fact that people are watching me do my work helps me be what they expect me to be. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s like working exhibitionism.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nBack home in Toronto, with my ergonomically correct chair, spacious desk and dedicated Internet connection, I pulled up my notes from the journey to Laptopistan and tried to write. Within 10 minutes, I was lost in Facebook and watching old \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSoul Train\\xe2\\x80\\x9d clips on YouTube.\\nSo I unplugged my laptop, traded my sweat pants for jeans and walked two blocks to the nearest coffee shop. There was some country music playing at a comfortable volume, and the familiar sight of cords along the floor. I took a seat between a guy working on an identical MacBook Pro and a woman drawing in a journal, and I worked like I was back in Atlas: productively, contentedly, fueled by a steady diet of Earl Grey tea, an economically acceptable quantity of cookies, and that social pressure I was craving.\\nAfter an hour or so, the guy next to me got up to go to the washroom, turned toward his laptop and looked at me.\\nWith a nod, I completed the transaction. When he walked away, I smiled. It was not a big smile; most likely it was barely visible to anyone looking beyond my screen. Precisely the secret smile that citizens of Laptopistan allow themselves when no one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s looking.\\n', \"a popular parkside promenade running along the east river for more than a mile on manhattan's lower east side has been closed indefinitely for structural repairs, depriving fourth of july celebrants of a waterfront site for watching fireworks this week, as well as joggers, bikers and strollers who use it daily.\\nthe commissioner of parks and recreation, henry j. stern, said yesterday that the east river park promenade, which skirts the river from east 14th to montgomery streets, was shut down last week after an inspection found severe deterioration in most of the wooden pilings that support the esplanade.\\n''two divers were making a study of the manhattan foot of the williamsburg bridge and the seawall that runs down from 14th street,'' mr. stern said. ''it is not a dry seawall. the promenade and some of the park is built on pilings. basically, the divers reported that up to 80 percent of the pilings under the promenade were deteriorated.''\\nthe commissioner said repairs to the pilings might take two or three years, and that the 30-foot-wide promenade used by hundreds of joggers and strollers regularly would remain closed for the duration. but the closing will not affect use of east river park, a 57-acre swath of softball and baseball fields, tennis, basketball and handball courts, picnic areas and other amenities.\\nthere was no immediate estimate of the cost of the repairs. mr. stern said city engineers had long recognized that the promenade seawall was deteriorating and would have to be replaced at an estimated cost of $10 million. he said that $865,000 had already been budgeted to plan for the new seawall.\\neast river park and its promenade date from the 1930's, when they were built in the era of robert moses, a city official known as a prolific builder of highways, parks and other public projects. the park, the largest in lower manhattan, is the front yard of a series of city housing projects -- jacob riis, lillian wald and baruch -- and is used by thousands of lower east side residents.\\nmr. stern said a temporary fence would be erected between the promenade and the park at a cost of $60,000. yesterday, only yellow police tape cordoned off the promenade. the police plan to put sawhorses and assign officers along the edge of the park wednesday night, when thousands of spectators are expected to gather there to watch the macy's fourth of july fireworks display.\\nthe fireworks will be set off from four barges in the east river between east 23rd and east 42nd streets. the best viewing will be along franklin d. roosevelt drive from 14th to 42nd streets, as well as from areas of brooklyn and queens with an open view.\\nalthough the promenade had not previously been closed, mr. stern said there had been problems with weakened portions of its railing over the river and that restrictions last year had been imposed to keep fireworks spectators from the edge.\\n\", \"south williamsburg and wall street have two of the highest concentrations of renters under 25 in new york city, according to the 2000 census. but youth is about all they have in common.\\nthe city's 1995 revitalization plan for lower manhattan precipitated a wave of residential conversions in the financial district. from 1995 to 2000, 1,577 residential units were created between fulton and liberty streets east of broadway, according to the alliance for downtown new york, a business group. last year, 22 percent of those units were rented by people under 25.\\njonathan falcone, 23, moved to the area last year, after graduating from the university of pennsylvania. next month, he and three friends will move into a $6,000-a-month three-bedroom penthouse on john street.\\nbrian g. edwards, leasing director at the halstead property company, said people in their 20's had led the migration into the neighborhood because most of the units are studios and one-bedrooms, landlords accept shares, and the area lacks amenities that attract families.\\nby contrast, hasidic williamsburg is a bright, noisy tangle of children, strollers and trees. rabbi david niederman, executive director of the united jewish organizations, said most of the century-old brownstones in the neighborhood's heart had been carved into small apartments that rent for $700 to $1,000 a month.\\nin the past decade new construction has allowed established families, which often include five or more children, to move out of the central brownstone blocks into large condominiums to the west and southeast. a new generation of newlyweds is taking their place.\\n''we have 400 to 500 weddings a year in williamsburg of people between the ages of 19 and 22,'' rabbi niederman said. ''because we don't believe in family planning, immediately after the wedding you're counting the days for your first baby.''   erika kinetz\\n\", \"fred wilpon became a new york real-estate plutocrat, the builder of tall towers along gilded blocks of manhattan avenues, by excelling at the art of the calculated risk. the grandson of an immigrant brooklyn street peddler, wilpon left bensonhurst on a full scholarship to the university of michigan, and by age 30, he was back in new york, betting everything he had on reviving faded uptown properties -- and making lavish returns. later, wilpon was in the east village before the boutiques, and he saw potential in bedford-stuyvesant when others saw only vacant lots and broken glass. ''he has,'' says his son jeffrey, ''a nose for this stuff.''\\nbut there are the rare times when he doesn't need it. in wilpon's business, every so often a proposal comes along that is so lush in its promise of profit and so elegant in its appeal to the deal maker's particular aesthetic that it requires no shrewd discerning at all. early in 1998, wilpon received just such an offer from mayor rudolph w. giuliani.\\nwilpon, now 64, is not simply a real-estate developer. along with his partner, the publishing heir nelson doubleday, he owns the new york mets, and it was for this reason that the mayor of new york had come calling. some months before, the mayor had met with george steinbrenner, the principal owner of the yankees. steinbrenner, wilpon learned, had told the mayor that he hoped a baseball stadium could be built on staten island to house a yankee minor-league team. this made sense. minor-league baseball attendance was booming as never before -- good for the boss -- and the northeastern coast of staten island was badly in need of an economic fillip -- good for the mayor. what the pair now wanted from the mets amounted to what people in real estate, like fred wilpon, refer to as the ceding of territorial rights. because the yankees and the mets share baseball jurisdiction in the city, the yankees could not place even a minor-league competitor in the area without the mets' blessing.\\non the face of things, such a blessing would have been highly unlikely. just a year before, the mets had hoped to place a minor-league team on long island, only to have their efforts blocked by the yankees. there lingered, as the mayor puts it, ''a certain amount of resentment.'' but the brooklyn-born giuliani also knew something about fred wilpon that went beyond his existence as a wise man of property. that is, wilpon had been a childhood habitu\\xc3\\xa9 of ebbets field, the ballpark the dodgers left behind when they moved to los angeles in 1957. the mayor says he believed wilpon was like almost everyone else from that generation of brooklyn natives -- a nostalgic, still recovering from the loss of the dodgers. with all that in mind, he threw wilpon his very fat pitch: you give steinbrenner staten island, he'll give you brooklyn, and the city will build small ballparks for each of you, design them to your specifications and rent them to you on long-term leases for nominal considerations. by last fall, two pairs of steam shovels had broken ground.\\nin staten island, word that a baseball park was rising in the old railroad yards, along the shoreline near the st. george ferry terminal, excited the locals. across the narrows, in the borough of churches, the same news was received like something on the order of the second coming. wilpon immediately became a modern-day duke of flatbush: he was the hometown boy who made good across the river and then brought the prodigal pastime back to the game's most impassioned fans. the new team was named the cyclones, and before the season even began, 80 percent of the entire summer's worth of tickets were sold. wilpon quickly added a thousand more seats to his ballpark, and soon those, too, were going like cheesecakes.\\nand yet there were others in brooklyn, skeptics, to whom wilpon merited no more than a plangent ''fuhgeddaboudit.'' in place of the dodgers, wilpon was serving up these cyclones, who would slap their singles and ground-rule their doubles against outfits like the lowell spinners, the batavia muckdogs and the mahoning valley scrappers. the cyclones were to be a low-level mets farm team, members of the short season (76 games) class a new york-penn league, meaning that wilpon had presented a fabled city of strivers with just the imprimatur it always dreaded: he was the major leaguer who made brooklyn into a minor-league town.\\n''they don't look minor league at all,'' wilpon was saying. he was seated in a luxury box at keyspan park, the home of the cyclones, inspecting his charges, who were displaying competence beyond their classification while drubbing the vermont expos. that same observation applied even more accurately to wilpon's surroundings, for they are what have very quickly made the brooklyn cyclones a truly compelling proposition. wilpon did not simply broker the dual feat of importing the sport of the provinces into new york city while returning professional baseball to brooklyn. he situated his team in the midst of one of the world's most famous entertainment settings, the five-mile spit of sand jutting into the sea known as coney island. the ground on which the young cyclones were blowing away the baby expos once held steeplechase park, the first of the coney island grand-scale amusement compounds. for generations of americans, coney island was synonymous with escape, thrills, adventure, seduction and pleasure, making this among the more inspired locales ever to be seeded with a professional baseball park. the builder built well. the ballpark's graceless corporate nomenclature aside, the ambience is such that everywhere wilpon turned his head now, baseball was meeting with carnival to winsome effect.\\njust below him, along the interior concourse that frames the top row of seats in the stadium, vendors hawked soft ice cream, lemonade, handmade brooklyn italian ices, cotton candy, brooklyn beer and nathan's genuine coney island frankfurters. lining up for these regional delicacies was a crowd that looked decidedly more like new york than the swarm of louts and swells who -- along with unseemly ticket prices -- have made the trip to yankee or shea stadiums a decidedly mixed proposition for members of the metropolitan area's nonexecutive classes. with cyclones tickets ranging from $5 to $10, here everybody could pay, and a little bit of everybody had. there were young men in do-rags, young women sporting pink hair, girl scout troops and their leaders, high-school lads shaded by baseball caps and yarmulkes, college students in hand-held contact with their inamorati and moms, pops and offspring aplenty.\\nwilpon said that ''we don't want to trade on the dodgers -- we want to fit into this community,'' and at perfunctory glance, the appearances supported the notion. it is true that to wilpon's right the radio booth was emblazoned with the notice ''catbird seat'' in homage to that fabled vernacularist, the dodgers broadcaster red barber. down on the field, intertwined with the cyclones ''c'' above the bill on their caps, the cyclones did sport an iconic white dodger ''b.'' and the surfeit of advertisements painted on the outfield fences in fact included a tempting proposition from a brooklyn haberdashery to cyclones batsmen: ''hit this sign . . . win a suit!'' -- a shameless little madeleine recalling the old pledge from abe stark clothiers on the ebbets field wall.\\nanother swatch of the new barrier, however, promised to remunerate a line drive off itself with a free ride for the whole ballpark on the wonder wheel. and right there, in vibrant illumination just beyond the fence in left field, spun the famous ferris. there was also astroland, the glittering arcades of surf avenue, and brightest of all, that zeus of roller coasters, the cyclone itself. to straightaway center field, wilpon -- and his patrons -- could see strollers along the boardwalk, bathers drying out on the sand, gulls plunging from violet-hued twilight skies and sailboats bobbing in the atlantic. around in right was the spiffily repainted 271-foot-tall parachute jump tower (sans parachutes, alas). while it is true that keyspan park's sound system is both relentless and loud -- a craven feature of so many current professional ballparks -- wilpon had circled the floodlights in rings of bright neon and sheltered the grandstand under enormous blue-and-yellow-striped beach umbrellas. it was, in the end, a new coney island amusement ballpark, and wilpon was feeling rather proud of it.\\n''where'd all these people come from?'' he wondered. ''they weren't here last year.'' then he was riffing on baseball (''it's the american way!''), explaining that the soaring minor-league profits around the country are a function of local ownership and confessing ''a father's pride'' that 39-year-old jeffrey wilpon is the man in charge of day-to-day operations for this already lucrative first-year franchise. wilpon was wearing a checked shirt, butter-soft black loafers and a quantity of brilliantine that swept back the hair from his tanned, lean face. his wife of 41 years, judy, was a few feet away. wilpon may now live in a large home on long island, but he still serves dr. brown's cream soda to his guests, maintains close boyhood friendships -- one old brooklyn pal is sandy koufax -- and enjoys talking about his immigrant jewish grandmother, who pushed a fruits-and-vegetables cart along the streets of williamsburg; his father, who presided over a small brooklyn funeral parlor on coney island avenue; and his sister iris's husband, saul katz, his partner ever since way back when they had nothing.\\nyet although wilpon is a sentimental person, he has the ears of a man who has heard a lot of requests and the ease of someone with experience in deflecting them. wilpon is said to be seeking the better part of $500 million from the city to build the mets a new ballpark in queens. (his favored design resembles ebbets field -- with a retractable roof.) when the matter of these negotiations arose, wilpon suddenly noted a nifty play by the cyclones shortstop: ''they pick it! i like it!'' mention of his relations with his mets co-owner, nelson doubleday, which are said to be strident, produced only a garland for the cyclones pitcher: ''hey, this kid's got pretty good stuff!'' then guy conti, a mets roving minor-league instructor, stopped by to pay his respects, and wilpon listened avidly as conti gave impromptu talent evaluations, including testimony to the virtues of the cyclones' most promising player, the fleet, vividly named center fielder from puerto rico, angel pagan. two innings later, pagan walked, stole second and third and then scored on a wild pitch, generating much jubilation below and more of the same in the owner's box.\\nthat is the usual situation at keyspan park these days. all 7,500 seats sell out, the first-place cyclones win and even when they don't, the audience seems merely ecstatic. sometimes the play is ragged: exuberant overthrows, haphazard infielding, 55-foot fastballs and undisciplined swinging. but nobody, not even new yorkers, it seems, heads to minor-league games expecting to see jackie robinson, mike piazza or, for that matter, del bissonette. (you remember del: ''the dodgers have del bissonette/no meal has he ever missed yet/the question that rises/is one that surprises/who paid for all del bissonette?'')\\nperhaps flawless baseball is precisely what the cyclones fans don't wish for. they go to brooklyn for many of the same reasons americans all over the country now attend minor-league games in greater profusion than at any time since the 1940's, the glory days of bush-league ball. there are the keyspan park sight lines -- not a bad or distant view in the house. there is harmless between-innings fun, like the dizzy bat race. there is the opportunity to glimpse up close -- and maybe even chat with -- the mets heroes of yore, bobby ojeda and howard johnson, who are cyclones coaches. best of all is the chance to see the players when their future is in doubt, when they are not wealthy, jaded and truculent but merely young athletes chasing an elusive ambition for $850 a month -- making them a lot like the people paying to see them.\\none recent evening, from their seats behind third base, erika warmbrunn, a broadway stagehand, and peter guernsey, her stagehand boyfriend, were comparing the experience to ''time traveling.''\\n''it's baseball in the 40's,'' she said, ''when it really was america's game. a-rod strikes out, and he's still guaranteed how many tens of thousands of dollars per at-bat? here, a kid strikes out, and somebody who's watching says, 'that's it for him,' and the kid is gone. that's drama. that's real life. all that, and look where we're sitting for eight bucks.''\\na few yards away, in the cyclones dugout, was bobby ojeda, who went 18-5 pitching for the world-champion 1986 mets. eight years before that, he spent a new york-penn league summer in elmira, where he made $500 a month and was losing weight eating hot dogs every day and ''sleeping in hotels named after somebody's dog.''\\n''but i remember the realization 'i'm being paid for this!''' he said. ''it was a special, special time.'' most former major leaguers of ojeda and howard johnson's pedigree would rather be driving a golf cart than riding the class a buses again, but ojeda lives close by, in new jersey, has higher aspirations in baseball and recognizes that he is the human analogue to this version of minor-league ball; literally class a but more truly first-class-a. the well-appointed big-city ballpark and the proximity to shea stadium make a man feel better about his chances of ''chasing a dream,'' as ojeda calls the majors. ''these kids were here at the right place at the right time,'' he says. ''this is as good as it gets at this level.''\\nangel pagan would agree. pagan spent last summer in kingsport, tenn., and began this one at an upper-level mets class a team in columbia, s.c. he was hitting .300 and felt, therefore, somewhat aggrieved when guy conti told him the mets wanted him to go down and play center field for brooklyn. but the next time conti encountered pagan, even though the 20-year-old was sleeping on a cot in a temporarily converted classroom at a catholic school in bay ridge, he now pleaded to stay where he was. ''i love it here, and i don't want to move,'' pagan was saying now while signing autographs for an eager throng beside the dugout. ''last year in kingsport, there were 1,000 people a night. here there are 7,500 a night. in kingsport, you just see trees. here, there's lots of things.'' most of pagan's roommates shuttle between their dormitory rooms and the ballpark, spending spare time doodling on the school chalkboards, but two weeks into the season, pagan had ridden the cyclone and explored a little of coney island. ''last year, my mother sent me latin food express mail,'' he says, ''but there are latin restaurants on mermaid avenue. tonight i had pork, rice and beans -- my favorite.''\\nwhat is revelation for ojeda and pagan is rediscovery for eddy rosenthal. rosenthal is a brooklyn warehouse distributor who went to ebbets field as a child, and he thinks the cyclones are ''the best thing that ever happened to brooklyn.''\\n''when we were young, the place was mobbed,'' eddie says. ''it was a carnival on the side streets. there were booths and games and fortunetellers and fireworks. we'd walk on the boardwalk. then the neighborhood changed, and it got dangerous. you didn't want to go on the boardwalk anymore.''\\nat the turn of the century, coney island was the real crossroads of the world, and its millions of shimmering lights were the first sight of america for arriving european immigrants. in 1897, a brooklyn entrepreneur named george tilyou opened steeplechase park, the first coney amusement city, and soon there was luna park and then dreamland, places so fantastic in their design -- a luxurious hotel shaped like an elephant was just the start of it -- that coney became the physical symbol of the american machine age. everybody went. in the famed weegee photograph taken in july 1940, there are a million people on the beach. yet television, automobiles, shifting demographics and changing public tastes gradually obviated the big brooklyn amusement parks. the neighborhood became dangerous, with bodies washing up on the beach and gunshots punctuating the evening air that once had been filled with calliope music.\\nnow, with his new stadium, fred wilpon was explaining that he hoped to use the minor-league baseball revival to inspire a coney island revival. ''i used to come here with my father,'' he said. ''we've tried to integrate the coney island we knew and what we know coney island will be. the reason for this location, aside from the fact that it's beautiful, was the need for a first-class attraction people could come to with the family at reasonable prices and have safe, attractive fun. it has all the infrastructure. it'll become a vital community again. when the redevelopment of 42nd street was conceived, they said it couldn't be done. look at 42nd street now! i know this area, and i know the potential.''\\na five-minute walk down surf avenue from the ballpark, at his continuously running freak show, dick zigun was willing to believe that fred wilpon just might be a sort of george tilyou for the disney era, an impresario who understood the pleasure-seeking tastes of his time in a way that would once again lure crowds to the brooklyn shore. zigun operates the annual mermaid parade and the nonprofit concern coney island usa, headquartered in his musty little sideshow gallery of sword swallowers and bed-of-nails acts. ''financially, we haven't seen any change yet,'' he says. ''but in terms of people's impression of coney island, there is already a significant change.''\\nnot everybody has been persuaded. kevin baker, the author of ''dreamland,'' a novel set at turn-of-the-century coney island, and the leader of historical tours of the area, says he believes that fred wilpon is the beneficiary of ''corporate welfare,'' a man making a profit that was handed to him by a lame-duck mayor concerned with ballpark legacies. ''nobody consulted the public about whether we'd like to pay for these new ballparks,'' he says. ''they're great, but what do people who don't go to the games get? a tax bill. and new yorkers who do go are being double-taxed because they have to pay for their seats. it's a coney island scam.''\\nthe most prominent student of the financial effect of ballparks on their surrounding neighborhoods is a harvard-trained smith college economist named andrew zimbalist, the editor, with roger noll, of ''sports, jobs and taxes.'' zimbalist says that while it is reasonable for a community to claim there are ''cultural benefits'' to having a minor-league stadium in its midst, ''there is simply no economic argument for the city as a whole to subsidize a ballpark at coney island on economic grounds.''\\nnaturally, mayor giuliani considers this the worst sort of prevarication. ''andrew zimbalist is castro's economist,'' he says. ''he does not understand a capitalist economy.'' the point, the mayor explains, is that the ballpark ''allows people to rediscover coney island. it's a way of showing off coney island so people come back for other things besides baseball.'' as to why there was no referendum for taxpayers to say whether or not they wanted to build fred wilpon and george steinbrenner these new minor-league ballparks, the mayor's answer is: ''because they would have voted it down. that's why you need a leader. somebody who has some vision.'' his legacy, he says, will be forging ''the anchor of the economic redevelopment of two neighborhoods that desperately need it.''\\nin the sleek fifth avenue skyscraper where his company, sterling equities, keeps its headquarters, fred wilpon considered this modern phenomenon of municipalities building ballparks for team owners to use in private enterprise. ''i know what economists say,'' wilpon said, ''but i also know what the history is when baseball teams vacate a city.'' it was then suggested to him that, in this case, nobody was leaving. the minor-league teams, in fact, seemed to want nothing more than to come to new york. wasn't the city needlessly paying for him to turn a profit? couldn't he have built his own ballpark and still made out fine? wouldn't he maybe even have forgone some of the profits just for the satisfaction of helping out the old neighborhood?\\nwilpon was on his way to a meeting. pausing in his building's italian marble lobby, he stood there, in a pinstriped bespoke suit stitched for him by a tailor who has also outfitted several presidents, and considered his motives with the cyclones. since this is baseball today, they are a mingle of pleasures and profits. ''it wasn't all money,'' he said. ''i have a passion for this. i would have done it if i knew we'd break even.'' then he mused: ''if i knew we'd lose money, would i have done it? probably. yes. on an emotional basis, not on a business basis.''\\n\", \"in the window of a video store on bedford avenue in williamsburg, brooklyn, hangs a poster for the 1968 film ''chitty chitty bang bang,'' in which a young boy and girl enter a land curiously devoid of children. seeing the offending visitors, the townspeople gasp in horror, and the young pair are soon spirited away by a gaunt, long-haired man in tight black clothes.\\na similar gasp could be heard two months ago in williamsburg, home to many gaunt people in tight clothes, when a bedford avenue storefront that had long housed the local art supply store reopened as sam & seb, the neighborhood's first baby store.\\n''it's deplorable,'' said sean kennerly, a williamsburg writer who watched in despair as the stenciled words ''discount art supplies'' disappeared under a coat of shocking pink paint. ''it's one more sign of the deterioration of the neighborhood. you always figure there are places for people who want to have kids. like over in park slope.''\\nbabies have long been a fixture in the area's latino, polish and hasidic communities. but the pioneering artists and those who followed them to williamsburg in the last 20 years seemed to float above such corporeal concerns as pregnancy and child-rearing. they were known for pierced navels and creative facial hair, for cigarette-filled afternoons and all-night roof parties.\\ntheir coolness made headlines across the country, drawing others to the industrial-chic streets and causing the utne reader to declare williamsburg the third hippest neighborhood in america (after the lower garden district in new orleans and the inner mission district in san francisco). a sexy convergence of grit and glam, williamsburg was hardly a place for miniature pudgy people who slobbered food down their shirts and were too young to smoke.\\n''i moved here 11 years ago from park slope to get away from all the babies,'' said an actor-contractor who asked that his name not be used. ''you walked up seventh avenue, and you had to wiggle yourself to get past stroller after stroller.''\\nonce, he and others like him were safe. as recently as five years ago, babies were a relatively rare sight in hipster williamsburg. then, about two years ago, they started to pour out of the warehouses and onto the sidewalks.\\nsigns of change abound. the williamsburg northside preschool on north fifth street, which started with three children in 1999, is expecting more than 100 in september and will move to a bigger space this week. the number of children taking classes at the stable, a local dance studio, increased from three or four in 1997 to 72 today, and the studio offers pre- and postnatal yoga. tops on the waterfront, a neighborhood supermarket, reports increased sales of baby oils, soaps and organic foods.\\neven people having babies have been taken aback by the explosion. kate murphy, a 36-year-old advertising director who lives in the area, recalled seeing ''the odd stroller on bedford getting weird looks from the calvin klein models,'' and when she became pregnant last year, she said, ''i didn't know that this was the right place necessarily to have a baby.'' watching preparations for the new baby store, she thought, ''i'll be your only customer.''\\nto ms. murphy and others like her, the store is a godsend. it's not just the snakeskin bibs, the jane's addiction onesies or the installation art of multicolored baby heads in the window that make williamsburg's new parents feel at home. it's also the relief at finding a local hangout where they can meet like-minded others.\\n''new mums come here, and they just hang out for hours,'' said simone manwarring, one of the owners. ''they sit here and breast-feed. they know we're not going to say, 'you can't use our bathroom.' it's sort of like a safe zone.''\\nms. manwarring, a local art exhibition coordinator, opened the store with amanda williamson, an artist neighbor. the two first-time mothers got the idea after too many treks to manhattan in search of both baby items and contact with other mothers. nevertheless, even they were surprised by the response when they posted a sign-up sheet inviting new mothers to bring their babies to the shop for a get-together.\\n''i thought we'd have maybe 3 mothers, but we got 18,'' ms. manwarring said as her 15-month-old son, sam, toddled about on the store's brightly colored floor tiles. a few days later, the list shot up to 30.\\npeeling paint isn't baby-friendly\\non the morning of the first ''new mums'' meeting (so termed by ms. manwarring, an australian, and ms. williamson, who is south african), women spread out on the floor, sipping mint tea and guava juice, playing with babies or rubbing bellies that contained them. they heard presentations by shirly weiss, a holistic nutritionist, and by philippa woolley, who runs the stable.\\nafterward, the women discussed the drawbacks to breeding in the 'hood: the raised eyebrows; the power plants, waste transfer stations, and other pollution sources; the artists' lofts whose flaking paint and soaring windows are hardly child-friendly.\\n''our landlord said babies don't belong in williamsburg,'' said ms. murphy, sitting on the floor with her daughter, isabel, who is just a few weeks old. ''it's the kind of building where a lot of artists live, and i think she didn't want to deal with it.''\\nms. woolley nodded. ''we had a home birth,'' she said, ''but we didn't tell our landlords.''\\nstill, these new mothers are not about to leave williamsburg. most lived here long before becoming pregnant, and they don't mind being icebreakers. they are in their 30's, they are finished with the dating scene, and they are less concerned with the neighborhood's cool quotient than with fighting for more parks and better education. williamsburg's public schools score badly on citywide tests, and a parents group has received a $25,000 grant to start a local charter school, although they have yet to get approval from the city.\\nit is not hard to spot more subtle changes on local streets. the staff at hello beautiful, a new, psychedelically painted hair salon, entertain clients' babies during haircuts. wythe avenue's sleek, silver relish diner, the locus of many a film shoot, most recently the one for ''angels in america,'' recently invested in a wooden highchair. the brooklyn brewery on north 11th street holds a smoke-free friday night open house at which babies make their way around the gleaming beer tanks as their parents swig microbrew and shoot pool.\\ndiscussions about babies in williamsburg inevitably turn to the subject of gentrification. but longtime residents point to escalating real estate prices as the true culprit, and note that many of the local residents having babies are artists who have lived there for years. many of them are also the owners of the places that helped make the neighborhood hip in the first place.\\n''all the bars the hipsters hang out at, the l cafe, pete's candy store, the girdle factory, earwax, their owners are all having babies,'' ms. manwarring said. ''everyone who owns all these businesses that they like, all the people they admire in the neighborhood.''\\nreminders of mortality, or of suburbia\\nhere is williamsburg's take on babies, based on comments that steve deriseis, ms. manwarring's husband, heard last month as he stood on a ladder painting the baby store.\\nthose who made snide ''there goes the neighborhood'' comments were typically young and male. longtime residents told him they were glad about the change, especially that the space was not going to become another new bar. perhaps most surprisingly, childless women in their 20's loved the idea.\\n''it's amazing,'' said ms. manwarring, whose long red hair and upturned nose make her look more like a bright-eyed schoolgirl than a grown-up mother. ''there's so many young women who come in here who don't have babies and aren't close to having babies. and they buy stuff for the baby they'll have one day. they go nuts. they go absolutely gaga.''\\nthe singer bjork, who is pregnant, spent 45 minutes in the store one day, buying not baby clothes but 11 finger puppets. ms. williamson found this interesting. ''i didn't think bjork had 11 fingers,'' she said.\\nyoung men are a harder sell. to many, babies are a drooling refutation of their commitment-free lives, a reminder of their mortality. not to mention that strollers and baby bottles look frighteningly like suburbia.\\nsitting surrounded by motorcycles at a sidewalk table at relish, mr. kennerly, 34, insisted that he had nothing against babies per se. ''the polish and hispanics have been raising their kids here for years,'' he said. ''that doesn't bother me. it's fine to have procreative impulses as long as you don't inflict them on the neighborhood.'' what bothers him about what he calls the ''yuppie babies'' is the ''assertive cuteness'' imposed on them by their parents.\\n''i think upper-middle-class people have a much more narcissistic involvement with their kids than poor people,'' said mr. kennerly, who grew up in texas and colorado (and whose discussion of babies was sprinkled liberally with curses). ''it's the gurgling and the cooing that i can't stand. people just don't let their kids be. they're convinced that their kid is the most amazing thing that ever happened on the planet. but i didn't realize how dire the situation had become'' until the baby store opened.\\n''when the baby stores open,'' he said, ''you know the bourgeois has the neighborhood firmly in its grasp.''\\nmontgomery knott, a lanky music producer who favors beach hats and low-slung jeans, found it bizarre to see strollers on industrial streets that were recently the domain of prostitutes, though he added, ''at some point i'm sure it was pretty bizarre to see children on the cobblestones of soho.''\\nhe wasn't bothered by the babies until a couple of months ago, when he bought a new apartment. a couple with a 5-month-old moved in next door, and suddenly the late-night, video-enhanced ''listening parties'' on mr. knott's mattress-strewn floor were interrupted by knocks on the door and appeals for quiet.\\n''what are people thinking?'' he said. ''do they think they're moving into park slope or something? i'm interested as a homeowner in the value of my space, and i know that families bring in value.'' but there are limits. ''anyone,'' he said, ''even in the suburbs, should be allowed to throw a blowout party.''\\nhighchairs amid smokers\\nlast weekend at sam & seb's opening party, as strollers gridlocked outside and pink and white balloons strained against their strings, a tall man with a mohawk, a nose ring and a silver front tooth watched his small son and daughter run around. a woman with tattooed arms and a guitar sang upbeat children's songs, courtesy of ''music for aardvarks,'' a local children's music program. an infant in a sex pistols t-shirt crawled across the floor.\\n''it's kind of hard to believe: we grow older and have kids,'' said dan siegler, a new father and the owner of the l cafe, an art- and artist-filled establishment ever since it opened a decade ago next to the l train stop.\\nnow mr. siegler was at sam & seb, handing out fliers announcing the l's new children's menu, which started last week and lists crayons, highchairs and ''baby-ccinos'' (steamed milk with foam served with animal crackers).\\nnot all of mr. siegler's employees share his vision.\\n''when we talk about where the cafe is going,'' he said, ''i'm talking about a kids' menu, and they're talking about d.j.'s and sangria.'' part of that is attributable to a generation gap: he is 39, and many of his employees are still in their teens. but mr. siegler also sees baby stores and children's menus as part of a natural evolution, much like the changes that transformed soho and greenwich village.\\n''every few months there's this fear that it will no longer be everyone's little stretch of bohemian paradise,'' he said, referring to a recent series of starbucks scares. ''ultimately, that's going to happen, and ultimately the people who gentrify the neighborhood are the ones who complain loudest about the degree to which it gets gentrified.''\\nbut it's not just about ideology. there are more practical objections to the baby boom.\\n''they're messy and they're annoying,'' said amy chin, a 23-year-old waitress at diner, a local restaurant. ''it's a smoking bar, and people bring their babies in there at 11 at night. who does that?''\\nwhile williamsburg parents don't necessarily subscribe to traditional mind-sets about the hours babies should keep or the places they should frequent, everyone seems to agree that babies and smoking don't mix.\\nthe father with the mohawk and nose ring at sam & seb was wearing a nicotine patch. mr. siegler, who quit smoking four years ago, says smoking is the stickiest issue at his cafe as the highchairs are pulled out more and more often amid the all-day blue haze.\\n''i would love to make it a no-smoking restaurant,'' mr. siegler said. ''people say we'll lose all our smoking clientele, but my feeling is those people would be replaced by people who don't smoke and want to eat and spend money rather than sitting for three hours over a cappuccino.''\\nto that, mr. kennerly said, ''my reaction is just: 'yuck.' ''\\nin ''chitty chitty bang bang,'' the adults-only spell is finally broken when hordes of children rise from their hiding places in the sewers, causing mayhem in the royal court as they reclaim their rightful place. while williamsburg's change of heart may be slightly less dramatic, it is nevertheless happening as the baby-to-hipster ratio threatens to approach parity.\\nwith so many babies parading around, is williamsburg in danger of losing its ''third hippest'' status?\\n''you know, i hope it does,'' said mr. siegler, the owner of the l. ''hipness has long become uninteresting. it's an uninteresting thing to aspire to. if you spend all your time trying to preserve that, then how cool can you possibly be?''\\naside from a few hostile comments, new parents say the neighborhood has a friendly, small-town feeling that seemed to increase when they had their babies.\\nsome say they feel a deeper connection to the neighboring ethnic communities. ''the mexicans next door, they just can't believe that this white person is having a baby,'' said a very pregnant blond woman at the new mothers' meeting. ''they talk to me now.''\\nand that actor who moved from park slope to escape the strollers? there was a reason he didn't want his name used. not long ago, he and his girlfriend built a small wooden annex to their bed. they needed to make room. for a baby.\\n\", \"an guide to cultural and recreational goings-on around the state this week. items may be submitted by mail to on the towns, sunday new jersey section, the new york times, 229 west 43d street, new york, n.y. 10036; by fax to (212) 556-7219, or by e-mail to njtowns@nytimes.com.\\nmusic\\ncontinental airlines arena britney spears. saturday at 7:30 p.m. tickets: $41.75 to $77.50 tickets: $37 to $117. 50 route 120, east rutherford.

(609) 492-9477.\\n\", \"they are a fixture of night in the city, just like the colored lights on the empire state building and the mexicans who tend flowers at 24-hour delis. young children, up late.\\nthe phenomenon is clear to anyone who visits the city's streets, subways, stores and fast-food restaurants after 10 p.m. summer is prime time for the wee hours, and the city that never sleeps is filled with children who seem not to sleep enough.\\nlate august is also when school looms and, experts say, when parents most need to ease their children into earlier bedtimes. but schoolbooks were a distant thought at 1:30 a.m. on a recent thursday in times square.\\non that night, seven cousins, 3 to 15, transformed the corner of 42nd street and seventh avenue into a playground as they laughed, shouted and swung from low-hanging scaffolding. supervising the rowdily friendly bunch was their grandmother, shirley ann quintero, and her husband, jose saavedra.\\n''when i was little, my dad used to bring me out to play the arcades in times square, so i decided to bring my kids out and do the same thing,'' said ms. quintero, who lives in the same building as her charges on the grand concourse in the bronx. the special occasion justified the late hours, she said.\\nas the quintero clan swung from the scaffolding, ahmed farraj, 10, and his family entered a nearby subway station. they had just been to see the movie ''signs'' and were headed home to sunset park, brooklyn. despite the late hour, ahmed was not tired, he said.\\n''you know why?'' he asked. ''because the lights, they're too shiny, and it looks like it is not even dark yet. it looks like it's the morning.''\\nin astoria, queens, yehia ghazi, a gregarious egyptian immigrant, also understands the powerful draw of the city's bright lights. ''i love the night,'' he said. his children, khalid, 7, and khloud, 5, are also developing a taste for it. ''they go to bed at 12:30 or 1'' on school nights, he said. ''if you wake up at 7:30, that's enough sleep.'' during the summer, he added, they are up even later.\\nthere have been no studies of the sleep habits of the youngest new yorkers. impressions can be misleading, too, and not just because a late night may be a rarity rather than a routine. a child playing outside an apartment building late at night will be seen by hundreds; a suburban child logging onto the internet from a bedroom is nearly invisible. also, naturally, there are plenty of new york city homes where early bedtimes are alive and well.\\nstill, experts offer several reasons why early bedtimes for children may be scarcer in new york than elsewhere.\\nfor starters, city dwellers have always been night owls. ''there's more competition for sleep'' in urban areas, said dr. judith owens, director of the pediatric sleep disorders clinic at hasbro children's hospital in providence, r.i. ''it's much more of an artificial environment. there's stuff going on 24 hours a day. stores are open, parents are working. there's just much less reliance on your natural circadian rhythms.''\\nat most hours of the night, new yorkers can buy books, rent videos, work out, eat korean barbecue, even be arraigned in manhattan criminal court, which is open all night three nights a week.\\nfor workers, too, new york is a sleepless town. ''new york city has more 24-hour operations than your average city,'' said dr. jack connolly, president of shiftwork consultants, a firm in port washington, n.y., that advises around-the-clock businesses.\\nbodega and transit workers are obvious examples, but old-school manufacturers, like the domino sugar plant in williamsburg, brooklyn, also tend to run all night. even for lawyers, secretaries and others who work regular hours, ambitious new york is just not a 9 to 5 place.\\n''the economy doesn't close down at night,'' said mitchell l. moss, director of the taub urban research center at new york university. ''so what's happened is that many parents do not come home until late in the evening and that's when they spend time with their kids, doing chores, helping with homework or shopping.''\\nthese urban characteristics are accompanied by other, more general social pressures that can mean less sleep for children, from the trend to more homework to the multiplying number of computer games and television shows. combined, these forces raise the specter that bedtimes for city children, already late, may grow later.\\nbusy parents, busy children\\ndr. laura popper, an associate professor at mount sinai medical school and a pediatrician who primarily deals with upper-middle-class families in her private practice, often observes busy parents trying to carve out time to spend with equally busy children.\\n''if you're an investment banker and work incredibly long hours,'' she said, ''something's going to have to give.'' even for parents who achieve what experts advise -- giving elementary-school children regular bedtimes and 9 to 11 hours of sleep a night -- the task can be exhausting.\\nliz swig, who lives on the upper east side, feels lucky if she can get her sons, simon, 11, and oliver, 7, to bed at 10 and 9:30, respectively. they do not frequent the streets or play many video games; their lives are just busy. between the two, there's tennis two days a week, soccer, art class and hebrew school. last year, simon had up to an hour and a half of homework as a fifth grader at the horace mann school, in riverdale in the bronx. oh, and there is the small matter of eating dinner.\\n''there's no time for them to try to just chill out,'' ms. swig said. ''conceptually, children need their sleep. but it's very hard to do it.''\\nby the time simon's daily whirlwind is done, it's almost 10, but ms. swig allows him to stay up a little longer.\\n''don't you think he deserves downtime?'' she asked. ''don't you think he deserves the equivalent of his glass of wine a day?''\\nlike the swigs, many parents, especially in middle-class neighborhoods, list a litany of school and extracurricular activities. but even when they are done, bedtime is not necessarily quick in coming. ''i see kids who really are burdened with hours and hours and hours of work,'' dr. popper said. ''they really can't wind down from it, so they're awake.'' experts say quiet time before bed is important for good rest.\\nthe night shift\\ndaysi mel\\xc3\\xa9ndez can understand these pressures. a honduran immigrant raising three children on her own, ms. mel\\xc3\\xa9ndez works 4 to 10 p.m. three days a week in a laundromat in park slope, brooklyn. on her days off, she insists that the kids be in bed by 9. but when she works, it is not until 10:45 or so that she picks them up at the baby sitter's house in bushwick, brooklyn, where ms. mel\\xc3\\xa9ndez lives.\\nshe says she knows this pattern is not good for the children, that they may not be able to concentrate in school. ''the poor kids go to bed at midnight, by the time they take a bath and i change them,'' she said. ''it's hard, but it's necessary. it's temporary, just for now.''\\nbut there is nothing temporary about the work schedule of mr. ghazi. ''all my life i work nights,'' he said, adding that he always will. when his family first joined him from egypt in 2000, he drove a bakery truck on the 2-a.m.-to-noon shift. the only time he had for his family was at night before work, and the kids often stayed up until he left. he would teach them english words or tell them stories in arabic.\\nnow mr. ghazi works in an east village restaurant, sahara east, from 5 p.m. to 4 a.m. he sees his children when they come home from school and on monday, his day off. but the family's late nights continue.\\non a recent monday evening, mr. ghazi and his wife, amal monsor, were in their small three-bedroom apartment on a quiet astoria street. it was 11 p.m., and the two children were sitting on the couch, watching an egyptian movie on satellite television. the living room was decorated with images of ramses and nefertiti, enlarged passages from the koran and eight clocks.\\nin the next hour and a half, khalid played the video game ''fighting force 2'' on his playstation, studied his pok\\xc3\\xa9mon cards and tuned in stations on his walkman. khloud lay on her parents' bed, flipped through dr. seuss's ''foot book'' and played with stuffed animals, including a gorilla, a baby giraffe and an eyeless kermit the frog.\\nthe children were energetic and adorable, but they began to falter by 12:30 a.m. drifting toward the bedroom where they share a colorful bunk bed, they began looking through a collection of picture books.\\nat 12:50 a.m., back in the living room, khloud announced she wanted to go to sleep, but with a catch. she wanted her older brother to come to bed too. khalid was not tired, but mr. ghazi ordered him to go with khloud wait until she fell asleep and then come back. khloud collapsed on the lower bunk, face down. khalid leaned against the yellow bunk ladder, reading ''huggly's snow day.'' the eyeless kermit sat in the corner. about 1:15, after a brief return to the living room when his sister had dropped off, khalid went to bed.\\nsuch patterns are familiar to dr. owens. she has studied the sleep habits of lower-income children from the providence area, and said her findings also apply to new york and other big cities with large immigrant populations.\\n''a large number of these kids have parents working two jobs or three jobs, and many working a night shift,'' dr. owens said. ''there isn't anybody to supervise bedtime, and bedtime in the families isn't really a structured concept.''\\nsuch a pattern can be a problem. a recent study of 187 elementary-school children in two-parent homes by dr. jodi mindell, associate director of the sleep disorder center at children's hospital of philadelphia, shows that children's sleep is affected in families in which at least one parent does not work a typical 9-to-5 day.\\nsummer in the city\\non a recent hot evening in washington heights, kids swarmed outside, riding scooters, sitting on stoops, eating chinese takeout and playing basketball.\\nthe heights is one of the city's most densely populated neighborhoods, so for every kid in the street after midnight there were probably many more tucked in bed. but the sheer number of kids outside in this area on a steamy night makes every corner look like a day care center. on some blocks, speakers blare merengue or bachata so loud from windows that it is hard to imagine anybody inside the building asleep.\\nyou are never too young to join this party. about midnight on a recent sunday, three strollers stood unoccupied at audubon avenue and 178th street. they belonged to shaunoly p\\xc3\\xa9rez, 2; justin minaya, 1; and aliyah beltr\\xc3\\xa9, 1. with encouragement from her mother, valerie malav\\xc3\\xa9, aliyah wiggled her hips to a merengue song by sergio vargas. the children's parents and grandparents egged her on, and aliyah smiled.\\nasked why shaunoly was not in bed, her mother, charo p\\xc3\\xa9rez, was defensive. ''today's the only day she's breaking night, so i can spend some time with my parents,'' she said, saying shaunoly's usual bedtime is around 10.\\nthis scene is at once strange and familiar to jose beltr\\xc3\\xa9, aliyah's father. he grew up in washington heights and remembers wishing his parents would go upstairs so he could go to sleep. but since he moved, things are different. ''i live in florida and i don't see my neighbors,'' he said.\\nhis wife, ms. malav\\xc3\\xa9, added, ''there's not really that hanging out that you do here.''\\na few blocks away, henry s\\xc3\\xa1nchez made the rounds on his scooter, despite the occasional admonition from his father, luis, to stay nearby. many members of the s\\xc3\\xa1nchez family were gathered outside their audubon avenue building.\\n''let's consider something,'' mr. s\\xc3\\xa1nchez said when asked about the street scene. ''the heat. not everyone has their little air-conditioner.''\\nchurch is another reason for staying up late. in washington heights and other immigrant and minority neighborhoods, some children attend pentecostal churches on weekday evenings. the rev. adalberto de jesus of the church of god, on crotona avenue near east tremont avenue in the east tremont area of the bronx, said that years ago he scaled back his wednesday services to end no later than 9:45 p.m. he wanted the children, usually about a third of his 30 or 35 wednesday worshipers, to return home.\\nbut, he said, many other churches are not as conscientious. ''i don't think they realize the full negative effect that is happening,'' he said. ''on the other hand, if you're going to weigh the positive and the negative, there are more positives than negatives from the effect church has on children.''\\nstaying up late in the summer is not a big problem, dr. mindell said, as long as the child does not have to wake up early for camp or day care and gets enough sleep over all.\\nbut, she warned, children who make a quick switch as school starts will have troubles. ''parents need to realize that the transition cannot happen overnight from a summer sleep schedule to a school sleep schedule,'' she said. she compared it to jet lag after flying from california to new york.\\n''with some of these kids,'' she added, ''it's more like they're on hawaii time.''\\n\", \"correction appended\\nat engine company 204 in cobble hill, brooklyn, the police used two vans to cart away 12 protesters who had invaded the firehouse to keep it alive. at engine company 212 in williamsburg, protesters rushed in and jammed pieces of lumber to prop open the door. one man chained himself to the bumper of the fire truck, and others sat down in front of it. eight people were arrested.\\nafter months of debate and legal battles, the city closed six fire companies yesterday in brooklyn, queens and manhattan. several of the closings went smoothly, although bitterness and sadness lingered outside the buildings' front doors. but confrontations in harlem and brooklyn exposed emotions so raw that their intensity surprised the police officers and fire officials on hand to keep order on the overcast sunday morning.\\nthe six companies -- four in brooklyn, one in manhattan and one in queens -- had been ordered to close down and cease responding to radio calls at 0900 hours, or 9 a.m. the city had long argued that in these six cases, other fire companies nearby could respond to emergencies just as quickly, and the overlap of coverage was too expensive in such perilous financial times.\\nthere were hugs, tears and somber goodbyes among residents and firefighters at the firehouses where the order was quietly followed. at engine company 209 in bedford-stuyvesant, the closing barely interrupted the firefighters' morning coffee and treadmill workouts.\\nat engine company 36 in east harlem, however, protesters chanted angrily. waving banners reading ''they go, we die,'' they lined up in front of the house and blocked firefighters from parking the fire truck inside.\\nmayor michael r. bloomberg, speaking to reporters in forest hills, queens, reiterated his contention that the closings would not pose a safety threat to local residents. he said that all of the firefighters were being reassigned and that the six companies had been chosen carefully by fire chiefs because ''all of them are reasonably close to other firehouses.''\\nthese were the first firehouse closings in the city in more than a decade, and the mayor faced political opposition, lawsuits and no small criticism over them. but the mayor, who was lightly booed at two memorial day parades yesterday in queens, has maintained that this is a politically tough but necessary measure to balance the city's budget.\\nclosing firehouses has never been easy. in 1991, four days after mayor david n. dinkins ordered the controversial closing of engine company 294, in richmond hill, queens, two brothers died in a house fire nine blocks away. rudolph w. giuliani seized on the issue when he ran against mr. dinkins for mayor in 1993, and reopened the firehouse shortly after he became mayor.\\non saturday, a man rammed a white van into the front doors of four firehouses in brooklyn. one firehouse door was jammed shut, preventing firefighters from responding to two calls. none of those firehouses were among the ones scheduled to be closed.\\nas of yesterday, officials had not found the driver or speculated on his motive. but there was talk among firefighters that the incident could have been an attempt to keep the city from closing the four brooklyn firehouses by disabling others that would assume their duties.\\nthe 20 people who were arrested yesterday were charged with criminal trespassing and disorderly conduct, said firefighter robert calise, a spokesman for the department.\\nat the firehouses that drew protests, demonstrators began arriving before 8 a.m., carrying coffee cups, waving signs and pushing baby strollers.\\nabout 200 people gathered outside engine company 204 in cobble hill. there were parents, politicians, activists. there was a sept. 11 widow, and there was the actor steve buscemi, a former city firefighter who lives in brooklyn.\\na handful of demonstrators began to voice outrage that the firehouse was being closed. others put down their coffee and began chanting along. speakers began lambasting mr. bloomberg's decision, and the gathering grew heated. just before 9 a.m., protesters linked arms in front of the building, preventing the firefighters from leaving. a fire captain from the house, brenda berkman, stuck her head out a window and joined in the criticism of the mayor.\\nby 11:15, the protesters were storming the firehouse and opening the large door so others could enter. just after noon, police officers arrived and began making arrests.\\nat engine company 212 in williamsburg, there were about 100 protesters by 8 a.m., chanting in english, polish and spanish and setting up sidewalk barbecues to grill hamburgers. two conga drummers arrived and began beating out rhythms.\\nsuddenly, paul veneski, 38, of williamsburg, an unemployed truck driver, slipped into the firehouse through an open cellar door and opened the garage's large red door. other protesters -- among them bronislawa hupalo, a rail-thin 80-year-old -- charged in and struggled to jam it open with discarded lumber. .\\nmr. veneski then chained himself to the fire truck. his 12-year-old daughter, jennifer, cheered him on. later in the three-hour standoff, she offered her father hamburgers through a small space in the door.\\napparently, trying to save firehouses runs in the veneski family. mr. veneski's father, adam veneski, a local grocer, stormed this very firehouse when it was threatened with closing in 1975, the family said.\\nat engine company 36 in east harlem, about a dozen protesters chanted against the closing. a sarcastic ''for rent'' sign on the door listed some of the building's assets: ''eat-in kitchen, covered parking, sliding pole.''\\nalthough unhappy to see them go, the protesters cheered the firefighters as they carried out their gear.\\nlee decker, 35, a firefighter with engine 36, said that many firefighters from the company, both active and retired, spent the night at the house, rehashing memories and deciding who would keep communal possessions bought with their own money, including a washer-dryer, dishwasher, refrigerators, couches, televisions, stereos, vcr's and an extensive collection of exercise equipment.\\n''they're breaking up a big family here,'' firefighter decker said.\\nin sunset park, brooklyn, a small group of teary-eyed firefighters and residents gathered outside engine company 278 at 9 a.m., not so much in protest as in resignation. as they hugged each other, brian horan, 48, of sunset park, a 13-year veteran with the company, loaded his belongings into his car.\\n''i think it's a disgrace to the members of the force who died in 9/11,'' he said. ''it's a slap in their face.''\\nthe scene yesterday seemed just as poignant at engine company 261 in long island city, queens. it shared a firehouse with ladder company 116, so the house itself would be staying open.\\nat 8:30 a.m., a handful of firefighters there sat dolefully on the bumper of their truck and listened to local democratic elected officials criticizing mr. bloomberg and gov. george e. pataki for cuts in financing.\\nat 9 a.m., deputy fire chief john acerno conducted a somber roll call, saluting their efforts and ''dedication, loyalty and many sacrifices.''\\nby the end, some firefighters were in tears.\\ncorrection: may 28, 2003, wednesday  a picture caption on monday with an article about the closing of six fire companies in new york city gave a misspelled surname in some copies for assemblywoman joan millman's chief of staff, who was among those who protested outside engine company 204 in brooklyn. she is corrina freedman, not friedman.\\n\", \"those who live by bedford avenue and south fourth street in brooklyn had their 11th-mile welcoming all set for the new york city marathon runners yesterday. salsa music blasting from a top-floor window filled the street, volunteers lined up to hand out water and spectators held up signs for the runners.\\n''victoria, the runners,'' maria molina told her 5-year-old daughter, who sat in a small lawn chair, as the first female runners passed.\\nfor molina and others who live nearby, the marathon is more than an annual event. it has become a neighborhood tradition.\\nseveral of her family members gather every year to hand out water and cheer on the runners. molina's mother makes chicken soup and hot chocolate for the neighbors, and they play the salsa music from molina's home.\\nmolina's father first began hydrating runners with a hose 20 years ago, then became captain of the 11th-mile water station, which runners pass just after the williamsburg bridge. her brother-in-law, john alfaro, is now a co-captain.\\n''it is something we grew up with,'' molina said.

''maybe in the future they can run in it, too.''\\n\", \"correction appended\\nsabato f. catucci stalks the piers on the red hook waterfront in brooklyn, where he has built a thriving business handling cargo containers, lumber, coffee and cacao beans. mr. catucci, the owner of american stevedoring, has plans for a liquor distribution center on pier 12, where his company would unload beer and spirits bound for brooklyn, queens and long island, bringing hundreds of new jobs to red hook.\\nbut last month, the port authority of new york and new jersey told him it would not extend his lease of piers 6 through 12 beyond april, while it explored ''alternative uses for the property.'' though representative jerrold nadler says he may have persuaded the port authority to grant a temporary reprieve, the longer-term fight to save mr. catucci's maritime operation is just one skirmish in a battle raging through red hook and neighboring gowanus over the future of the hardscrabble area.\\nthe small manufacturers, distributors and businesspeople who have helped revive that stretch of the brooklyn waterfront in the last decade say the city and the port authority are writing off the area's maritime and industrial base in favor of a future filled with luxurious waterfront apartments featuring spectacular views of manhattan and governors island. they say rents have risen sharply and speculators are holding industrial properties off the market in the belief that the city will rezone the area for residential development -- a move they contend will make it all but impossible for many of these companies, and thousands of jobs, to survive.\\nthe struggle mirrors what is happening in long island city, queens, and greenpoint and williamsburg, brooklyn, where gentrification and a shift to residential zoning are under way, worrying manufacturers who provide blue-collar jobs.\\n''this is in many ways the most complex land-use battle in the city,'' deputy mayor daniel l. doctoroff said of red hook. ''you've got competing uses, with tradeoffs between jobs, waterfront access, housing, retail jobs and industrial jobs. it requires a very textured approach.''\\nhe and other city officials say that a good number of red hook's buildings sit unused or underused, so the city and port authority are studying the area to determine how to make the transition from an industrial waterfront to an office-based economy. they will not say whether they envision luxury apartments, though they say they favor a mixed-use neighborhood where residential and commercial developments coexist.\\nbut the small-business owners say coexistence is a pipe dream. a boom for luxury apartments will price them out of the neighborhood, they say, and the new developers and residents will have little tolerance for the gritty realities of a working waterfront.\\n''people who live in red hook depend on these jobs; they're willing to put up with the truck traffic and the congestion,'' said igor katsman, vice president for operations for snapple distribution, which rents warehouse space and employs 250 workers. ''but when you start putting up $500,000 condominiums, those people don't want trucks on the streets.''\\nin the meantime, mr. katsman said, he fears that the uncertainty over the area's future will put him out of business. ''nobody wants to give us a long-term lease because they're all speculating that the zoning will be changed to residential,'' he said.\\nmr. doctoroff said that the city and port authority expect to complete their latest study on the future of piers 6 through 12 sometime this month. he also said that mayor michael r. bloomberg plans this spring to issue the city's long-awaited policy on preserving industrial space citywide.\\nbut there is an increasing fear at community board 6, whose district includes red hook, that the bloomberg administration has a different vision for the neighborhood. last month, the city granted a variance to convert four floors of a six-story industrial building to 152 luxury apartments. the red hook-gowanus chamber of commerce filed a lawsuit opposing the variance, saying it would touch off a conversion craze.\\n''it feels like red hook is being dismissed as the viable maritime and industrial community that it is,'' said phaedra thomas, the chamber's administrator. ''they've determined that its future is as a luxury waterfront community.''\\nuntil the 1950's and 60's, much of shipping industry in new york harbor docked in red hook and south brooklyn, where longshoremen, warehouse workers and truckers lived in the neighborhood and walked to work. most of the jobs disappeared as the port authority built a modern container port on the other side of the hudson river in newark and elizabeth, n.j., a move that is still seen as a profound betrayal in brooklyn.\\nbut in the last 10 to 15 years, the red hook waterfront has come back to life as light manufacturers, artisans, distributors and woodworkers moved into abandoned industrial buildings and shipping resumed on some of the piers. according to a survey by the south brooklyn local development corporation, the number of businesses in red hook climbed to 457 in 1999, from 291 in 1991.\\nmr. catucci said he moved 110,000 shipping containers at the red hook container port last year, up from 18,211 in 1994. he established the biggest port for cacao beans in the world, although it has lost ground in recent years to camden, n.j. and philadelphia. he said he employed roughly 750 workers, including many from the nearby red hook houses, where unemployment runs as high as 30 percent.\\nthe port authority has complained that it spends millions of dollars a year subsidizing a barge that transports the containers from brooklyn to new jersey. but mr. catucci says he pays about $6 million of the $10 million cost of the barge and is developing plans for beverage and food distribution centers that would import goods bound for brooklyn, queens and long island, not new jersey. he says that could eliminate the need for the barge in five years.\\nif the city decides that in the long run the piers could be better used for housing or recreation, he said, he will gradually move his business to the largely deserted south brooklyn marine terminal. but he has lost business while the port authority kept him in limbo over his lease -- and the city, he said, could lose hundreds of jobs, once again to new jersey.\\n''i'm not going to stand in the way of progress, but i've got to know where i'm going,'' he said. ''we lost 400 jobs at domino sugar last week. i don't want to lose these jobs, too. you'll never get them back.''\\na senior city official suggested that the loss of american stevedoring could be offset by new jobs at a passenger ship terminal, an ikea store and a fairway supermarket all proposed for the area.\\nrobert hughes, manager of the erie basin bargeport, where 500 people work on barges and tugboats and at a beer distributor, said it was critical that the city retain red hook as its last working waterfront aside from howland hook in staten island. tom fox, president of new york water taxi, said the growth of ferries would continue only if there are places in the harbor to berth, repair and service boats.\\n''there's a mile or more of waterfront property that, depending on the whims of elected officials, might be taken out of maritime use,'' mr. hughes said.\\na year ago, carnival, the big cruise ship company, worked out a proposal with the local community board and mr. catucci to build a $100 million passenger terminal at pier 7 for the queen mary 2 and other ships, because of overcrowding at the city's terminals on the west side of manhattan. but the city rejected the plan. yesterday, kate ascher, an economic development official, said the city would invest $250 million over the next 10 years in passenger terminals, including two berths in red hook, although she acknowledged that she did not know where the money would come from. in the meantime, the city offered carnival a temporary berth at pier 7.\\ncommunity leaders worry that if the city does not move more quickly on a permanent terminal, carnival will follow royal caribbean, another cruise line, to bayonne, n.j. ''we expected the departure of royal caribbean would be a wake-up call for the city,'' said giora israel, a carnival vice president. ''but so far we haven't received a viable proposal.''\\nbruce batkin, an owner of the building at 160 imlay street that was granted a residential variance, said he thought the city's study indicated that the waterfront was well suited for residential development, despite the lack of public transportation. across a short stretch of water, he said, the city plans to create a resort and conference center on governors island.\\n''we think this should be a template for successful coexistence of commercial and residential,'' he said.\\njeffrey levi, chief executive of john's gourmet, a high-end food manufacturer that employs 70 people a block away from imlay street, is not convinced. the people moving into expensive apartments, he said, will have concerns about truck traffic, noise, smells and dumpsters. he pointed out how the gillies coffee company in sunset park, another brooklyn industrial neighborhood undergoing gentrification, was fined by the city last year after a resident complained about the smell of coffee.\\nwith the area's future so uncertain, mr. levi said he is considering moving to new jersey.\\n''for me to expand, it means i would have to invest another quarter of a million dollars,'' he said. ''i'm not sure it makes sense if i'm going to have baby strollers rolling down the block.''\\ncorrection: march 2, 2004, tuesday  an article on feb. 4 about development along the brooklyn waterfront misstated the role of community board 6 in a now-defunct proposal by carnival, the cruise ship company, to build a $100 million passenger terminal in red hook. it has generally supported the idea, but it did not negotiate a deal with carnival.\\n\", \"a guide to cultural and recreational goings-on around the state this week. items may be submitted by mail to on the towns, sunday new jersey section, the new york times, 229 west 43d street, new york, n.y. 10036; by fax to (212) 556-7219, or by e-mail to njtowns@nytimes.com.\\ntheater\\nafrican globe theaterworks ''out of sight and out of her mind.'' one-woman comedy with e. denise peoples. performance in celebration of mother's day. today at 5 p.m. tickets: $25. newark symphony hall, 1020 broad street, newark.

''we didn't want to get into a situation where we were locked into a place like the village, which has lost its edge,'' mr. skroupa, 44, said. the strollers, he said, were reaching a ''critical mass.''\\nin the 2000 census, the area represented by chelsea's central zip code, 10011, had the highest concentration of male same-sex households in new york, according to gary j. gates, a demographer, who with jason ost, a researcher, compiled ''the gay and lesbian atlas.'' chelsea's concentration of male same-sex households is seven times the percentage in new york overall, according to an analysis of census data by the sociology department at queens college.\\nbut a raft of new condominium developments and rising prices in nearby neighborhoods have drawn more straight residents to chelsea. in the past four years, developers have built or renovated about 2,000 condo and rental units, most too big for singles. with ''condos with doormen and two and three bedrooms, automatically come the families and the straight people,'' said leonard steinberg, a broker with douglas elliman in manhattan, who is himself gay.\\nolder buildings where gay residents represented 75 to 80 percent of the population five years ago are now at least 50-50, mr. steinberg said. some buildings now have more straight residents than gay, he said.\\nwhile some gay residents may gasp at straight stroller gridlock, it should come as no surprise. twenty years ago, when gay men and women began to leave the west village for chelsea, straight families moved in to take their place. now, as chelsea's gay incumbents disperse to hell's kitchen and washington heights as well as fort greene and williamsburg in brooklyn, they are again being replaced by straights.\\ngay pioneers ''have been trailed all the way up the west side by straight couples with babies and volvos,'' said darren sukenik, a broker with douglas elliman, who is gay and lives at 270 west 17th street, a condo built in 1991. in the last six months he has sold six apartments in his building -- all to straight couples.\\nfor many gay residents the change gives rise to mixed feelings. on the one hand, the arrival of straight neighbors makes chelsea less of a ghetto. on the other hand, a safe haven of sorts is lost. ''my friends and i talk about this all the time,'' mr. skroupa said. ''this is what we wanted, but in a way we're losing our little nook in the world.''\\nalthough gay couples are also starting families, chelsea's identity was built largely on the gay singles scene, with nightclubs and bars still drawing gay men from around the city. the appearance of spruced-up playgrounds and child-friendly restaurants has thus taken on symbolic weight.\\nperhaps most striking was the opening of a warehouse-size buy buy baby on seventh avenue, near 25th street, a year and a half ago. ''it was a watershed moment,'' said gil neary, president of dg neary realty, who has sold real estate in chelsea for 20 years.\\nwhen abby and rob goldstein bought an apartment at the chelsea mercantile, a condominium a block from the store, mrs. goldstein worried that the neighborhood might not be convenient for children. ''but the day we came to do our walk-through, we saw a sign that said 'buy buy baby opening soon,' '' said mrs. goldstein, whose 23-month-old son, max, was born a month after the couple moved. ''so i said, i guess it'll be fine.'' now, said jamil canal, the mercantile's resident manager, the 352-unit building is home to 60 children, most with straight parents.\\nfor some residents, the baby boom signaled the end of an era. ''i did notice that when i started to get run over by those double-truck strollers, it was probably time to get out of chelsea,'' ted davis, a 40-year-old magazine art director, said with a chuckle. he moved to hell's kitchen last year and this fall will pick up again, this time for williamsburg.\\nsome lament the dilution of a supportive gay community. ''the young gay kids who are marginalized from around the country come here and then find they are priced out of the neighborhood,'' said johnnie tiedemann, who was shopping last week on eighth avenue.\\nsince 2000, the median price of an apartment in chelsea has increased by 57 percent to $1.18 million, according to the douglas elliman manhattan market report prepared by jonathan miller, an appraiser. at the same time, the average rent for a one-bedroom apartment in chelsea is $2,477, according to citihabitats, the manhattan brokerage firm, a level that prices many newcomers out of the neighborhood.\\nrichard silvera, 23, who was sitting in big cup last week, said he wanted to move to chelsea after graduating from new york university but couldn't afford it. ''young gay people don't have the money but need the perks of a gay neighborhood the most,'' he said. ''you have just come out, you are trying to figure out who you are and who your social circle is.''\\ngranted, it's not just affluent straight buyers and renters who have driven up prices. when the chelsea mercantile opened in 2000, some brokers took to calling it the gay millionaire's dorm because of its high sales prices. but turnover has brought in more straight buyers. linda gertler, a corcoran group agent, said that of 14 apartments she has sold in the mercantile since 2002, 11 have gone to straight buyers.\\nfor those who have been in the neighborhood for a while, straight buyers have meant opportunities for profit. ''the gays came in and gentrified the neighborhood, and it's become a much nicer place to live,'' said christopher mathieson, a broker with jc deniro & associates. ''and they're now cashing out and making a lot of money.''\\nsome straight families, meanwhile, say chelsea now has a healthy fusion of lifestyles. ''our hallway in the mercantile is an amazing combination of young couples, gay people, families, older people, professionals and people who are at home,'' said sophie miodownik, who moved there three years ago with her husband, aron, and their children, ella and zack, now 5 and 3.\\ngay residents who feel ambivalent about living in a gay-identified neighborhood welcome the mix, too. ''we certainly didn't pick the neighborhood as a gay cultural center,'' said david dabill, an advertising executive who bought a two-bedroom apartment with his partner last year. mr. dabill said they had never even been to a gay bar in chelsea. straight families in the building, he said, ''are kind of a nonissue.'' if anything, he said, ''it comes in handy when you're looking for someone to look after the cats.''\\nsome newcomers hope the neighborhood won't change too much. catherine davis and her husband, stephen, who are expecting their first child, fled the upper west side two years ago for london terrace, a complex of rental and co-op apartments on 23rd street. the day they moved in, ms. davis recalled, ''there were these two men decked out and spruced up in leather g strings on harley-davidsons, with huge wings, walking up 23rd street. i was like, 'oh, my god, i'm so glad i'm not living on the upper west side anymore.' ''\\njeff monford, a public relations executive who lives in the neighborhood, said, ''i'd like to think that mixing it up in the 'hood helps open minds and hearts and increases tolerance in general.''\\nstill, he said, communities that have undergone similar transformations, like greenwich village, retain their gay character long after the arrival of straight yuppies. ''the idea being that once we've been there, we leave a virtually indelible print,'' he said.\\n\", 'one month ago today, richard oceguera, 35, and thomas koveleskie, 33, celebrated their massachusetts wedding of last spring with a party on the roof of their home on south first street in williamsburg, brooklyn. sixty people attended this handmade ceremony, which sampled elements from early christian services -- both men are catholic -- blended with vows they had written themselves, followed by disco dancing to duran duran, book of love and late blondie.\\nas the sun set, the lights honoring the twin towers were lighted, along with those of the empire state building, and a flock of pigeons tumbled skyward from the roof of a nearby tenement (a happy coincidence). john gillespie, a neighbor, made a toast, which he recalled the other day. \"i said that this was a transformative event both for the guests, and the building,\" mr. gillespie said. \"it marked a new beginning for all of us, and it felt like a blessing on the building.\"\\nthis celebration, its setting and the coincidental atmospherics -- those lights, the pigeons -- underscore williamsburg\\'s 21st-century incarnation as a bedroom community for manhattan professionals. the residents of 150 south first street, the luxurious new condominium development where mr. oceguera and mr. koveleskie bought their 900-square-foot two-bedroom for $440,000 in july 2003, are prototypical of the area\\'s new citizens; many are couples looking to start a family.\\n\"we\\'ve already had a naming ceremony on the roof, for one of the two babies born in the building,\" said mr. gillespie, who is president of the condo board at 150 south first (his day job is medical director at pfizer in manhattan). \"and there\\'s another wedding planned.\"\\nno longer a haven for artists -- or even \"artists\" -- williamsburg feels more like georgetown in washington, than the east village, to which it has been compared. at 8:45 on any given weekday morning, bedford avenue is a river of well-scrubbed young professionals pouring toward the l train and their city jobs across the river. (the bedford avenue gloss is so powerful that the developers of 150 south first street, which is at the corner of south first and bedford, marketed their property as 299 bedford avenue.) by 10 the strollers are out, careering along the same strip or parked at fabiane\\'s cafe.\\n\"i never thought of myself as a \\'williamsburg kind of guy,\\' \" said mr. oceguera, who is director of business development at rent-direct.com, an online-service that connects would-be renters with landlords; he and mr. koveleskie had been renting together in brooklyn heights for four years.\\nmr. oceguera was crisply dressed in a blinding white shirt and zippered chocolate brown agnes b. sweater from paris -- he and mr. koveleskie had just returned from a honeymoon in italy and france -- and talking passionately about family and roots; he sees williamsburg as fertile ground for both.\\n\"even though this is our starter home, our first purchase,\" mr. koveleski said, \"we want to start a family here. we\\'ve hit all the milestones -- home ownership, marriage -- and the last one is children. our neighbors expect it of us.\"\\nthe men say their neighbors, mostly straight couples in their 30\\'s, are sharing parenting and adoption group news. \"we all seem to have a lot in common,\" mr. oceguera said.\\nit took one month for all 32 units here to sell, said helene luchnick, an executive vice president at douglas elliman who marketed the building.\\n\"at that time there was absolutely nothing else for sale in williamsburg,\" ms. luchnick said. its developers had planned the building as a rental property, until they saw the state of the market. it was ms. luchnick who suggested they build the rooftop deck, fitness center and kitchen. prices are about $500 a square foot, and rising. mr. oceguera and mr. koveleskie\\'s apartment was just reappraised, they said, at about $550,000.\\npatrice mack, a broker at elliman who sold the building with ms. luchnick, was surprised by the monolithic homogeneity of her clients. \"it was weird, we thought it would be artists or people from the area,\" she said, \"but instead it was this group from manhattan. they even had the same stuff. do you remember the aerosole \\'dollyanna\\' shoes from \\'sex and the city?\\' \" she continued. \"all the girls were wearing those.\"\\nold williamsburg, the one with the latin flavor, is still here: the vacant lot opposite mr. oceguera and mr. koveleskie\\'s living room terrace is filled with pumpkin vines. the \"artists\" are represented too: a juice bar around the corner has a street sign with the words haight-ashbury painted on its galvanized steel walls (there\\'s even a vw bus emblazoned with peace signs). but this couple mostly ignores such signage on their walks to emporiums like uva\\'s wines and bedford cheese down the block; both men love to cook.\\nthey met by chance six years ago in a chelsea restaurant. a few nights later, mr. oceguera, new to the city from chicago, was dialing around haphazardly for a dinner date. mr. koveleskie, vice president for equity and fixed income research at bbva securities, was the only one who answered his phone. it was 9 p.m. and he was working late. \"we\\'ve been inseparable ever since,\" mr. oceguera said.\\non may 24, day 6 of legalized marriage in the commonwealth of massachusetts, the men were the 350th same-sex couple to be married, they said. the state requires a three-day waiting period, but you can get a waiver, which they sought. the elderly male judge who granted it urged both to \"ignore the small-minded folks out there,\" as mr. oceguera remembers it. mr. koveleskie\\'s father told him, \"i looked up the definition of love in the dictionary, and it didn\\'t say it was only between a man and a woman.\"\\nmr. oceguera broke in. \"not to mention it\\'s always good for the economy when two gay guys get married,\" he said.\\n', 'yesterday was the kind of morning when you poured water onto the corn flakes. no sense running to the corner bodega if you were out of milk. the tv was showing temperatures that would look right on the jerseys of quarterbacks and kickers. and there were rumblings of a storm to come.\\nall through the windows, if you were lucky enough to have them, came fat beams of double-crossing sunshine, promising warmth that would not be delivered, not yesterday and not for a long while. it was cold out there.\\nstill, you couldn\\'t call it unexpected. it was mid-january already, late january really, and the forecasters were finally calling for the first big snowstorm of the season, one to make up for lost wintertime.\\n\"we\\'re in for, pretty much, a doozy for the weekend,\" said michael silva, a national weather service meteorologist. \"so far we\\'ve been pretty lucky, we\\'ve been pretty mild.\"\\nthe weather service was calling for a storm to cover everything over, with arctic air masses taking advantage of a dip in the jet stream and low pressure moving across the ohio valley, and for snow to start falling on saturday afternoon and to leave 12 to 15 inches on the ground, ending by sunday afternoon. there was a blizzard warning, too, for winds stronger than 35 miles an hour to blow that snow around. the best advice, the written warning said, is \"to stay indoors.\"\\nacross the city, people seemed to welcome that advice.\\n\"there\\'s a storm?\" asked a clerk at reel life, a video store in williamsburg, brooklyn. \"excellent. i\\'m going to watch some football, smoke some weed and chill out.\"\\nrenee price, a student at new york city college of technology, who was walking down jay street yesterday in a hat, scarf and long coat, was making indoor plans, too.\\n\"i\\'m going to go outside and pick up the paper at 6 a.m., sneak back inside and read,\" ms. price said. \"the heat is already set, the mood is right and the coffee will be on at 7.\"\\nthose with work to do were less enthusiastic, but they too bowed to the storm. the metropolitan transportation authority said it would suspend nearly all planned subway construction over the weekend.\\nfreshdirect, a company that delivers groceries, was making backup plans. \"if our employees can get here, we\\'re going to trudge through the snow,\" said steve druckman, a company spokesman.\\nand real estate brokers were canceling open houses.\\n\"people are saying, \\'if you have somebody to show to, call me and i\\'ll go,\"\\' said steven rutter, managing director of the corcoran group\\'s office in park slope. property owners, he said, \"don\\'t want people traipsing in with snowy boots, snowy strollers, snowy kids.\"\\nthe forecasters could be wrong, but mr. silva seemed confident.\\n\"most of our models are in agreement;

(now they point repeatedly to the new theater\\'s clearly marked exits.)\\nthe brick, a 75-seat theater on metropolitan avenue, is a production by another energetic duo, robert honeywell and michael gardner. the space, which was at one time an auto-body shop, shows dance and theater as well as a monthly performance series called \"brick-a-brac\" featuring local performers. this summer they hosted the hell festival, which included original work in addition to readings of hell-related texts like \"faust;\" the moral values festival -- listed as a performance festival for the morally questionable, morally perverse and morally bankrupt -- is on deck for next summer, inviting work from synchronized swimmers as well as playwrights.\\nwilliamsburg is also headquarters to two experimental theater groups cultivated by members of the now legendary wooster group: radiohole and collapsable giraffe. collapsable hole, as the groups have named their shared space, is a spare industrial box except for all the techie gadgetry. a dazzling array of video equipment makes possible shows like collapsable giraffe\\'s \"meat is floating by,\" in which company members acted out a nonlinear play in a camera-lined room that had been constructed onstage.\\nthe audience, seated on risers not far from the action, caught only occasional glimpses of the performers, but had constant view of them on a live video feed. at one point, the garage door leading out to the street was thrown open and the audience had to figure out that the show was over. when they wandered out to the deserted street, the actors had vanished except for a message on the sidewalk in chalk that signaled their departure. the group\\'s next show, \"letters from earth,\" an experimental theater piece inspired by interviews with conspiracy theorists and by mark twain\\'s novella \"letters from the earth,\" in which satan writes to michael and gabriel about how strange humans are, opens in march.\\nwith no signage, the hole is also almost impossible to find if you don\\'t know where you\\'re going. while the theater sometimes shows up in listings magazines, many other williamsburg spaces publicize only through insider e-mail blasts from sites like jeff stark\\'s nonsense nyc (www.nonsensenyc.com).\\nthe exception may be the neighborhood\\'s most successful venue, galapagos art space,the williamsburg version of p.s. 122 and its show nightclub rolled into one, with a reflecting pool at the entrance and fresh lilies in the restrooms. the club\\'s two stages feature musicians, films, performance art and variety shows, like the long-running monday night burlesque.\\nmeanwhile, the choreographer elizabeth streb, who has been presenting what she calls \"action work\" in new york city since 1976 and is the recipient of a macarthur grant, has taken up residence in a huge warehouse on north first street. the streb laboratory for action mechanics, or slam, has 30-foot ceilings, from which hangs a flying trapeze.\\nslam is nearly always open to the public. on one recent week day, a drop-in audience member was treated to rehearsals of ms. streb\\'s company\\'s next show. dancers were flinging themselves onto spring-based tumbleboards and bouncing off like rubber balls. ms. streb watched from a table as dancers tried running from opposite directions and throwing themselves onto the boards simultaneously without killing each other.\\nthe performance space monkey town will reopen in may after renovations are completed on a its fancy new space, which boasts a minimalist japanese aesthetic. montgomery knott, the handsome, hatted man who runs that space, says his new theater will seat only 32 in order to give audiences that lovely feeling of being nearly alone with artists. \"anyone who\\'s gone to a huge rock show or a giant museum exhibit knows that unless you have the perfect seat or the backstage pass or the preview ticket, your experience is colored by your level of discomfort,\" explains mr. knott. \"in our space, every seat is privileged by our economy of scale.\"\\non the other end of the size spectrum, a 7,500-square-foot club called supreme trading opened across from charlie pineapple in october with a pledge to stage all manner of entertainment, including theatrical work. and as recently as late january, the concert organizer todd patrick (better known as todd p.) announced on his web site (http://toddpnyc.com) that he is starting a new, as yet unnamed, \"diy art/show\" space in williamsburg.\\nsome worry that williamsburg\\'s success as a new theatrical hot spot contains the seeds of its own demise, as the neighborhood becomes increasingly expensive.\\n\"ultimately, and sadly, the struggle boils down to finances,\" said marisa beatty, the executive director of williamsburg art nexus (or wax), which recently closed after five years. \"i believe that the work of even the most promising creators suffers under the pressure to be the \\xc3\\xbcber-manager -- choreographer, costume designer, public relations director, dancer, producer and technical director -- of your own show. our cost of living directly feeds this cycle by making it nearly impossible to outsource these roles.\" while ms. streb has eight years left on her lease, most of the others\\' leases expire in the next two or three years, by which time, many believe, certain regions of williamsburg will have been rezoned into residential areas. that proposed change would increase the already rampant construction of condominium apartments, and the march of the maclaren strollers.\\ntheater companies and producers in search of cheaper rents have already begun to move further and further east along the l line to bushwick (referred to as \"east williamsburg\" by residents in denial). it\\'s a different, less diversified scene -- more slapdash, more rock \\'n\\' roll. the two most important of these spaces are asterisk and officeops (a converted office building best known for its \"rock \\'n rollerskate\" parties).\\nit\\'s probably just a matter of time before bushwick becomes the new williamsburg, just as williamsburg has arguably become the new lower east side.\\nms. huggans of collapsable giraffe is philosophical about the her group\\'s near-inevitable exile: \"we love our space in williamsburg,\" she says, \"but the second we can no longer find a good dive bar to drink at after rehearsal, we\\'re out of here.\"\\n', 'until recently, residents of brooklyn\\'s victorian flatbush have been all dressed up with no place to go. no place in the neighborhood, that is.\\nbut that seems to be changing with the slow but steady evolution of cortelyou road, the seven-block-long commercial section of a street that cuts through flatbush between coney island avenue and east 17th street. benches and new street lamps are on the way, as 99-cent shops, bodegas and hair parlors increasingly share turf with new businesses catering to a vast ethnically diverse clientele, affluent new arrivals and young families yearning for more service.\\nestablished businesses like the flatbush food co-op and the greenmarket, which has expanded, have been joined by new restaurants, a cafe with a bookshop, and an antique shop, cortelyou vintage, which is scheduled to open wednesday at 1118 cortelyou road. it will have mid-20th-century furniture and decorative accessories intending to cater to new residents coming from places like park slope and williamsburg.\\n\"i\\'m looking to capture the young hipsters who want unique furniture and who are not going to go to levitz and buy new,\" said the owner, nicole francis, who works as a financial planner and lives in a 10-room victorian house nearby. \"the key market is couples with young children.\"\\nshe pays $2,000 a month, or slightly more than $2 per square foot, for a 950-square-foot retail space, with a bonus 850 square feet of garden, according to dr. edmund lee, the building\\'s owner, who grew up in the neighborhood and whose chinese immigrant parents operated a hand laundry nearby.\\ncatherine hickey, director of economic development for the flatbush development corporation, said store rents on cortelyou road are typically $1.50 to $3 per square foot. vacancies are up, she said, as leases expire and landlords look for higher rents.\\nmost buildings on the street are brick, about 20 feet wide and three stories high, and were constructed around 1930, according to the department of city planning.\\nasking prices for commercial properties for sale are picking up after stagnating for decades. a 4,140-square-foot building at 1502 cortelyou road with four residential units and a ground floor bar, the cornerstone, is on the market for $1.3 million, according to jan rosenberg, a principal in brooklyn hearth realty ltd., a brokerage firm, and president of friends of cortelyou, the five-year-old group dedicated to improving the street. monthly rent for the bar space is in excess of $4,000.\\nthat price is higher than most on the road, where closing prices are typically in the mid-$600,000\\'s. a three-story structure at 1410 cortelyou road is in contract for $650,000, according to ms. hickey of the flatbush development corporation. the space is now a temporary headquarters for a transportation project. the buyers, salvatore and matteo amato, are brothers who plan to convert it to a restaurant and bar. their family has owned the adjacent san remo pizzeria since 1976.\\nwilliam del quaglio, who paid $245,000 for the building at 1416 cortelyou road about seven years ago, is now in contract to sell it for $675,000. mr. del quaglio used to run the bagel shop on the ground floor.\\nlike mr. del quaglio, the amato family and mr. lee, many property owners have long associations with the neighborhood. sales of buildings most often take place through word of mouth and without brokers.\\ncortelyou road is anchored at one end by the q line subway station, an associated supermarket and a duane reade, and at the other end by charmless auto body shops lining coney island avenue.\\nin between, the street has a kind of norman rockwell, small-town allure to it, complete with a fire company (da pride a flatbush), a red-brick school, a library, rambling old colonnaded houses, a playground, massive flowering chestnut trees in full bloom and unusually wide sidewalks that invite a pleasant amble. a mexican grocery store has pi\\xc3\\xb1atas hanging from the ceiling.\\nnamed for jacques cortelyou, a 17th-century tutor and surveyor who had a hand in establishing the town of new utrecht, the street had originally been called avenue c, according to the brooklyn borough historian, ron schweiger. around the turn of the 20th century, wealthy executives began moving into mansions on streets with lettered names and many were given upper-class british names like argyle, buckingham, rugby, marlborough and stratford.\\nuntil 1930, a trolley ran along cortelyou road. small businesses thrived until the 1960\\'s, when commerce started to slide and crime increased. improvements were slow to germinate as new arrivals in $1 million victorians or well-priced co-ops went elsewhere to shop and dine out.\\n\"we didn\\'t have a place where people came together and which created a sense of neighborhood,\" said ms. rosenberg of friends of cortelyou, which hopes to woo a bank and children\\'s clothing store to the area. \"and because the commercial strip was so small, i felt that only a few different stores could help create that change.\"\\nchange has gained momentum in the last 18 months. on weekend nights there are waits for a table at the popular picket fence restaurant, which opened a year ago at 1310 cortelyou road. its bustling back garden was recently made twice as large, and now seats 50 with plenty of room for families with strollers, according to the owner and chef, graham meyerson, who formerly cooked at the union square cafe and who lives nearby. dishes include a pecan crusted pork chop at $15, warm garlic potato chips at $5, turkey meatloaf for $12, and a house burger for $8.\\nabout 100 people from all over the city turned up at a recent book party at vox pop, 1022 cortelyou road, a new cafe and book shop that serves fair-trade coffees, $4 vegetable sandwiches and $6 organic turkey baguettes and whose motto is \"books, coffee, democracy.\"\\nthe owner, sander hicks, who lives over the shop with his wife, holley anderson, a singer-songwriter, and newborn son, coleman, runs a print-on-demand operation on a balcony over the bar. he was also the publisher of \"fortunate son,\" a biography of george w. bush, under his own imprint, soft skull press.\\nmr. hicks got a month\\'s rent free when he opened in november, welcomed by a landlord who wanted a tenant who would help improve the street. this kind of response to the community seems typical of the new cortelyou, he said.\\n\"even the food co-op is now open until 11 p.m.,\" mr. hicks said. \"they listen to their customers.\"\\nthe street will get added exposure in the next few months when picket fence and mr. meyerson, whose wife, chelsi, manages the seasonal greenmarket, are featured on a segment of \"roker on the road,\" with al roker, on the food network. according to ms. rosenberg, it is welcome recognition for the restaurant as well as the neighborhood.\\n\"people are finding their way here from around new york city and beyond,\" she said. \"it\\'s what we\\'ve been working for for several years.\"\\n', 'my friend ashton and her boyfriend, bob, are leaving ashton\\'s roomy, prewar apartment on west end avenue and buying a two-story house in williamsburg, brooklyn.\\nthey are not making a real estate killing, the only reason i would consider budging from the upper west side. like many of my fellow middle-aged upper west siders, i am hanging on for dear life to my bought-cheap apartment, and i\\'d hate to leave my friends, my pediatrician and my building\\'s invaluably helpful porters, the only two men i have actually considered leaving my husband for.\\nbut making money is not ashton and bob\\'s purpose -- which is good, since this up-and-coming neighborhood has up and come. though the parents of young-adult children from previous marriages, ashton and bob are bohemians at heart. they go dancing at clubs and have small, cryptic his-and-hers tattoos on their forearms. ashton moved to the upper west side from tribeca to be closer to her children\\'s schools, but now that her daughter is in college and her son about to go, she sees no reason to stay.\\n\"there\\'s just more street life,\" ashton explained, though a case could be made that the street life almost anywhere is an improvement over the street life that west end avenue has to offer, which is to say none.\\n\"we\\'re the first stop over the williamsburg bridge,\" ashton said, urging me to come and see her there. my first thought was, do i have to? williamsburg has always sounded far, far away, and while i felt awful about it, i was already looking for excuses for not to visit her there, wherever there was.\\ngiving brooklyn the back of your hand is a tradition in manhattan, long predating the objections brought on by the recent exodus, objections that seem to lay the blame on too many strollers, too many hipsters, too much bragging by new residents.\\nentrenched manhattanites, one of the most provincial tribes on the planet, are willfully ignorant about brooklyn. we may not be proud of the fact; i\\'m not, anyway, though i suspect some of my friends are. \"let me say this about that,\" said my friend ellie, who has lived for decades on the upper east side, when i brought up brooklyn. \"the thought of brooklyn has never crossed my mind and never will.\"\\ni have been to brooklyn a couple of dozen times over the years. i have taken my children to coney island to see a sword swallower, which was wonderfully terrifying, and to brighton beach to see the spangly russian circus on ice (leave before the skating bears, who will break your heart), and to the brooklyn museum and to the public library and to prospect park. but i have done each of these things only once.\\nother friends have had similarly dilettantish experiences. \"i went to paris before i went to brooklyn,\" admitted my friend lucy, who has lived in manhattan for 25 years. this seemed a little extreme, until i realized that i also went to paris before i went to brooklyn.\\ngetting there sounds so hard to us spoiled manhattanites, for whom nothing is that far away, by foot or public transportation. jesus himself could come to brooklyn and we would whine, \"i meant to go, but i don\\'t know, it just seemed really complicated.\" nor do we trust any brooklyn dweller\\'s blithe, easy-as-pie directions.\\njust as every manhattanite has a story about the fantastic apartment that got away -- the two-bedroom on gramercy park we could have bought for pennies in 1984 -- we all have a horror story about one spectacularly awful trip to brooklyn, the fiasco that we can\\'t ever seem to recover from.\\nmine was the trip to the brooklyn children\\'s museum with my 6-year-old daughter, along with a friend of mine and her 3- and 6-year-old children. the museum offers weekend trolley rides from grand army plaza, presumably to lure those daunted by the subway-and-walking directions you get over the phone. with our retinue, it seemed easier to take a taxi to the trolley, and we found a gypsy cab willing to take all five of us.\\nthe 3-year-old threw up shortly after we crossed the brooklyn bridge. the owner of a flatbush avenue hair salon kindly let us in so we could clean up, but it took another livery cab to get us to the trolley, which by then seemed less like a treat than an annoying attempt to distract travelers from the fact that the children\\'s museum was somewhere near jakarta. the cab we finally found to take us back to manhattan broke down on the exit ramp coming off the brooklyn bridge. it\\'s like that feeling when you\\'re stuck in traffic on the long island expressway; fair or not, you start to hate all of long island.\\nthe other day, to see what was happening for myself, i spent an afternoon in williamsburg, the cool part. i ended up flashing back to my youth: i am too old to shop at anyplace called earwax records, and the cloying smell of incense in the tibetan clothing shop sent me right back outside. but the place had a hopeful sweetness; my college-age daughter would love it.\\ni spent another afternoon with my family strolling through brooklyn heights, elegant and stage-set perfect, and from there to a scrappy area along columbia street called the waterfront district. we ducked out of the rain into a cozy used bookstore, where we sat and read in easy chairs until the rain stopped. we bought a toile tray and fat cupcakes at a combination bakery-curios shop. we poked our heads into a dark, dickensian furniture shop where deco and 50\\'s pieces were selling for a song. i browsed at a dress shop owned by local designers that featured a plate of rice krispies treats free for the taking. we loved every minute.\\nour guides were my nephew, glenn, and his girlfriend, katie. glenn, who moved to brooklyn heights from the east village last year, is not blindly in love with brooklyn; he misses his old all-night magazine store, and says the nearest bar/restaurant is bland in menu and atmosphere with, yes, too many couples with strollers. he longs for a nearby joint that\\'s rude and loud. but he loved brooklyn from the moment he stepped out of the subway at clark street to look at apartments. \"the exquisiteness was like a thunderbolt,\" he said. \"you can go from brooklyn heights to cobble hill to carroll gardens, and it still looks like henry james, block after block.\"\\nbrooklyn is his slice of heaven, and i can see why, but i already have mine.\\nthe new brooklyns/backlash jenny allen is a contributing editor at good housekeeping and a stand-up comic.\\n', 'at a party on the upper west side in 2000, a distinguished american author, and longtime manhattanite, asked where i lived.\\n\"brooklyn,\" i told him.\\nhe snorted. \"poor people live in brooklyn.\" then he turned away to get some meat.\\nshortly after the party, to see if i could move from my rented apartment in boerum hill, i went looking to see what i could buy in a part of fort greene where cars parked on the street were still regularly stolen. i told the broker that it would be nice for my kids to have a house by a park. \"we just sold a house by the park: $510,000,\" the broker said. but there was a catch. \"it had no walls or ceilings.\"\\nwhat happened, i wondered, to the distinguished author\\'s \"poor people\"?\\nseveral years ago before, representatives of the giant warehouse shopping club costco had approached the city planning department with a question: would it be worth it to open a costco in sunset park, an area of brooklyn that had lots of the aforementioned poor people? the economic data wasn\\'t encouraging. lots of asian immigrants lived in the area, and their median income was not high. also, the site was half the usual size, so the costco store would have to be built in two stories, with costly elevators and escalators.\\nbut the city\\'s statisticians advised costco to go ahead. there was money in those undistinguished apartment houses and wood-frame houses, they said, more money than met the eye. being an immigrant area, the neighborhood has a thriving underground economy, they said, and official housing data doesn\\'t account for illegally subdivided units.\\nthe store opened in 1996 and turned a profit in its first year. nine years later, according to company figures, it is among the nation\\'s highest-grossing costcos, earning upward of $150 million this year compared with $120 million for an average costco. in fact, the store has been so successful, the chain is considering opening another giant warehouse in brooklyn.\\nit has become a clich\\xc3\\xa9 to say that brooklyn is booming. but the change has become so broad -- sweeping up the yuppies of fort greene, the immigrant shoppers at costco, the hipsters of williamsburg -- that it looks for all the world like a difference not just in degree but in kind. long seen by that distinguished author and by so many others as a poor backwater, brooklyn now buzzes with a momentum that would have stunned residents of its sleepy streets not long ago. the change has effects salutary (a housing boom, thriving cultural life) and perilous (soaring housing costs, displacement), but the one constant is that it is huge.\\nwith 2.5 million people, the borough is bigger than san francisco, boston, atlanta and st. louis combined. the population is approaching the historic high of 1950, when brooklyn was home to 2.74 million souls. turn around, and you will see the renaissance. there isn\\'t a single vacant storefront along fulton street in bedford-stuyvesant, and hordes of shoppers throng pitkin avenue in brownsville. after decades of disinvestment in brooklyn, major projects are in the works, among them the development of 175 waterfront blocks, complete with 40-story luxury apartment buildings, along the greenpoint-williamsburg waterfront; the construction of an 800,000-square-foot sports complex for the nets in the atlantic yards; and, in red hook, the return of cruise ships, including the queen mary 2 and the queen elizabeth 2, to a major new pier and passenger terminal.\\nand while housing is exploding citywide -- the number of housing permits granted citywide last year exceeded the permits granted in all of the 1990\\'s -- the two boroughs with the most housing starts in this bustling market are queens and brooklyn. why so many homes? brooklyn\\'s prime appeal is relatively low cost. let\\'s not kid ourselves. if rents in manhattan fell, half the hipsters in brooklyn would rush the bridges; they\\'re a floating population. but it can\\'t be just that; otherwise staten island and the bronx would also qualify.\\npeople are also moving to brooklyn because -- who in the 80\\'s could ever have guessed? -- it has become so much safer. from 1990 to 2000, according to the state\\'s division of criminal justice services, car theft in the borough plunged by 75 percent, robbery by 67 percent and homicide by 69 percent. in terms of mass transit, it\\'s the best-connected borough after manhattan, with 167 of the city\\'s 468 subway stations.\\nas for me, i live in park slope because i\\'m a writer. it\\'s in my union contract. brooklyn has become the iowa city of the east, an area chronicled and cataloged and celebrated in countless novels and poems, read and unread. the number of brooklynites who identified themselves as \"authors and writers\" to the census bureau more than doubled to 3,111 in 2000 from 1,506 in 1990. by contrast, the number of \"cabinetmakers and bench carpenters\" dipped almost by half over the same period, to 334 from 602.\\nbecause of all the creative types who call the borough home, the new brooklyn is hip. one of the clearest signs of this was a 2002 cover article in time out new york that ran under the headline \"manhattan -- the new brooklyn\" and tried hard to make the case that manhattan was cool again. \"the upper east side is just a dorm,\" i overheard a young asian hipster say to a friend as they walked amid the milling crowds on court street. \"i like it here. there\\'s so much life.\"\\nsometimes all of south brooklyn feels like a giant set for a sitcom about trendy young people. on plywood barriers at a construction site on fourth avenue in park slope, i noticed a series of desperate public pleas for a change of heart by a departing roommate: \"i  3/5sheart 4/5 you scout please don\\'t leave\"; \"scout if you stay i\\'ll be nice to you all the time. even when i\\'m pms\\'ing\"; \"kate says if you stay, you can spend another night in her bed.\"\\nit was not always thus. the unnamed young irish hero of the gilbert sorrentino love story \"the moon in its flight,\" set in 1948, returns to brooklyn after a party with his sophisticated bronx girlfriend in equally sophisticated forest hills. at the party, \"he skulked in his loud brooklyn clothes,\" the novelist writes.\\n\"when he got off the train in brooklyn an hour later, he saw his friends through the window of the all-night diner, pouring coffee into the great pit of their beer drunks. he despised them as he despised himself and the neighborhood. he fought against the thought of her so that he would not have to place her subtle finesse in these streets of vulgar hells, benedictions, and incense.\"\\nbut the new brooklyn has more than one face. \"there are two brooklyns,\" pointed out arun peter lobo, deputy director of the population division of city planning. \"at the very least.\" indeed, anything you could say about brooklyn, the fourth-largest city in america, is true somewhere within its borders. yes, it\\'s full of hipsters; rhode island school of design students hop on the bus to williamsburg as soon as they graduate. yes, it\\'s full of parents, marching their strollers down union street to shop at the organic foods co-op. yes, it\\'s also full of immigrants.\\nalthough queens, the borough most thought of as the new melting pot, is home to more than a million immigrants, brooklyn is fast catching up, with 932,000. about 38 percent of brooklynites are foreign-born; if you include their children, their numbers jump to more than 55 percent.\\nthis isn\\'t the jewish brooklyn of woody allen or the italian brooklyn of \"moonstruck.\" there are people living in brooklyn who have no idea what stickball is, what stoop-sitting is, who the dodgers were or why they left brooklyn. these people play cricket in marine park, barbecue suckling pigs in their backyards, listen to russian matinee idols in brighton beach nightclubs, and worship not kobe bryant and derek jeter but diego maradona, an argentine soccer player, and sachin tendulkar, an indian cricket star. they are inventing their own brooklyn, a brooklyn their kids will be nostalgic about 20 years from now.\\nwilly loman, too, still lives in brooklyn. desperate working folks, salesmen and otherwise, struggle to provide for their families, to make the commission; attention is still not being paid. income disparities are as big as brooklyn itself; in 2000, the median household income in the wealthiest census tract -- in brooklyn heights -- was $112,414. in the poorest tract, in coney island, the median income, at $7,863, was not even one-tenth of that. the housing crisis exacerbates this inequality, with the world divided between those who own and those who rent.\\nanother big division in brooklyn is between neighborhoods close to the water, or to a park, and those away from the blue and the green. people live in the western parts of brooklyn with their eyes fixed westward. there are people in park slope who can tell you where to get the best gelato in manhattan but have no idea where to find the best roti in brownsville. well inland are the nonimmigrant poor, people who have been poor for a long time and aren\\'t just off the plane from somewhere else, aren\\'t hoarding hope for their children as they toil in sweatshops.\\nthe new brooklyn has not cured poverty or solved related problems like inadequate schools. low-quality schooling hits poor and immigrant families the most because it depletes the only substantial capital they have: their children. the children, with their great promise, are these families\\' microsoft before windows, their i.b.m. when it was just a typewriter company. when a public school succeeds spectacularly, like p.s. 321, in whose park slope district house buyers must pay a premium, parents storm the gates, with varying success. so it\\'s private school for many brooklyn parents -- at $20,000 a year. \"it\\'s become punitive living here,\" says a writer friend who was trying to raise her kids in park slope. she couldn\\'t afford a house, even though her husband is a corporate lawyer. eventually she left brooklyn to ride horses in a mountain village in spain, and is happier for it.\\nmoreover, the various redevelopment plans, grand as they are, are being fought block by block by people who will be displaced by them. the nets arena will sit in a spot that has among the best access to mass transit in the city -- \"every train but the f,\" as my landlord proudly said when i was renting an apartment near there in 2002. traffic, already hellish on flatbush avenue, may get still more hellish as several thousand fans converge at game time.\\nso there are downsides to the new brooklyn, but there is the boom -- and beyond all the economic data, there is a very human pull to the borough. in the world\\'s loneliest city, brooklyn offers community. everybody can find community in brooklyn: the body-fluid artists in bushwick, the chinese restaurant workers in sunset park, the die-hard marxists in the park slope food co-op. no matter how foreign or fringe you are, the borough has a support group for you.\\none reason for this is that brooklyn is famously a series of neighborhoods. another has to do with the physical structure of that emblem of brooklyn -- the brownstone. adjoining rear gardens facilitate communal interaction, gardening tips exchanged over a backyard fence. maybe what attracts the hipsters to brooklyn isn\\'t just cheap rents. it\\'s the closest they can get to the families they left behind, in kansas, in vermont, in tokyo.\\nfor me, brooklyn became a neighborhood one steamy august night in 2003. it was the night of the great northeastern blackout. in park slope, volunteers were out directing traffic at every intersection, even if the drivers laughed at them and zoomed past. other brooklynites shared phones and flashlights, or helped the elderly down dark stairwells.\\nas night fell, the texture of the city changed. the street lamps were out, and people strolled about with flashlights and lanterns. there was a bright white moon high above the city competing with the red glory of mars, the warrior planet, which hadn\\'t been so close to earth in 60,000 years. the ancient brooklyn tradition of stoop-sitting enjoyed a sudden revival.\\nat midnight, the bars were still dispensing ice for our whiskeys. we took our drinks out on the sidewalk; we\\'d make our own laws tonight. everyone\\'s face was illuminated in flickering, flattering light, and everybody looked beautiful and desirable. the floodlit megalopolis was transformed into a series of villages lighted by millions of small lights, in whose glow brooklyn was revealed to be what we had forgotten it really is: an impossibly romantic, a 19th-century city.\\nthe new brooklyns/signs of changing times suketu mehta is the author of \"maximum city: bombay lost and found\" (knopf).\\n', 'like many new yorkers, i groaned when the kmart went up in astor place in 1996. although i\\'ve been known to celebrate target\\'s underwear supply, and i bought my fax machine at best buy, i find nothing more overwhelming than browsing in a big-box store, with its booming pop music, jaundiced fluorescent lights and mind-numbingly endless aisles of products.\\nso i have been surprised to find myself among the many new yorkers converging on the container store, at 19th street and the avenue of the americas in chelsea, not just for the shopping, but for its restorative effect. at the container store\\'s 25,000-square-foot beachhead, devotees wander past the 70-foot-long wall of coat hangers in shades of peach and lime, past honeycombs of diamond-shaped sock organizers and lucite shoeboxes in every color of the rainbow, suffused with a feeling of tranquillity.\\nthe container store is dedicated to the proposition that there is a place for everything sprawling and untidy, and that that place is probably made of lucite and probably stackable. it has become such a familiar part of the shopping landscape that many of us can no longer remember where we bought coat hangers and milk crates before the store opened.\\neven those who secretly wonder just how many filing cabinets and in-boxes one person can possibly buy have been known to embrace this particular place. as if in a trance, they dreamily push their overflowing carts and smile as beatifically as stepford wives as they make their way down aisles wide enough to accommodate the twin strollers that have become the hallmark of latter-life procreators. track lights shine their heavenly beams on the portable canvas closets, the stacking totes, the tupperware and the galvanized metal storage cubes, all in soothing earth tones of khaki and moss and pewter.\\n\"it\\'s all possibilities in there,\" explained raina moore, a 34-year-old children\\'s book editor who lives in a 425-square-foot apartment in south williamsburg, brooklyn, and has a particular fondness for closet organizing supplies. she often makes weekly trips to the container store, whether or not she needs a new rattan gift box.\\nthe place gives ms. moore the illusion of power, tantalizingly holding out the idea that the chaos of her life, not to mention the clutter found in the typical 500-square-foot apartment, can be brought under control. \"everything in there is a solution,\" ms. moore said. \"as soon as you walk in, you just feel like your problems are solvable.\"\\nthere are thousands of tiny projects that can be finished with just a little help from these storage gurus. the moment i put the cat food in the purple plastic bucket with the spinning lid, i have achieved my goal. i\\'m relaxed just thinking about it.\\nsome container store disciples don\\'t even actually buy the stuff. so soothing is the place, they simply roam among its smorgasbord of items, fantasizing about the perfect compartmentalized closet, the perfectly organized spice rack.\\n\"you walk in, and you just feel this immediate sense of calm,\" says cris beam, a 33-year-old writer and avid container store browser, who lives in a 500-square foot apartment with her partner in morningside heights. during times of high stress, ms. beam has been known to frequent the container store several times a week; for her, even wandering the aisles empty-handed is enough to melt away the anxiety.\\nof course, there\\'s something else going on. we new yorkers, with our shoebox-sized apartments, our lack of garages and basements and attics, are the perfect audience for this particular chain store.\\nwhile organizational products have been available for years at container store competitors like hold everything, that store is relatively small, and caters largely to a more upscale clientele. bed, bath & beyond is the opposite: filled with clutter that only compounds a sense of imminent chaos. \"you go into bed, bath & beyond,\" ms. moore said, \"and you\\'re already having to move things around to fit that new thing that you\\'re buying.\"\\nthe container store, by contrast, follows a very calculated strategy. it offers just the right number of options -- enough to appeal to a variety of social classes (coat hangers range from 29 cents for the classic plastic tubular hanger to $19.99 for a cedar suit hanger), but not so many that you feel as if you\\'ve stepped into a vertical flea market. the chain has also made a conscious decision not to diversify: you won\\'t find hand lotion and gum at the cash register.\\nthe container store, which began in 1978 with a single outpost in texas selling industrial storage products that had previously been available only wholesale, now has 34 outlets. the new york store, though only 18 months old, is the chain\\'s most profitable; it did $24 million worth of business last year ($9 million in shelving alone), which is three times as much as the average container store.\\nfull-time employees -- a group that includes everyone from college students and grandparents to aspiring actors and disillusioned lawyers -- undergo 241 hours of training in

laundry basket. that laundry basket could work as a dog bed. the lucite storage bins can be used for holding winter clothes or seasoning a turkey (and customers have bought them for both purposes).\\none customer came in search of a way to divide her mother\\'s ashes among three sisters (a clerk presented her with four small tin paint cans and four silk-covered gift boxes in which to put them). another woman needed a box in which she could lock up her food; she was afraid that her boyfriend was going to poison her. even in issues truly involving life and death, the container store can offer at least a temporary solution.\\nurban tactics lisa selin davis\\'s first novel, \"belly,\" will be published this month by little brown.\\n', 'in some parts of new york, the word stroller elicits images of bugaboo behemoths and others like them that are popular in parent-heavy neighborhoods. but on wednesday, more than 1,500 strollers are expected to gather on staten island, and there will not be an infant in sight.\\nin this case, the strollers are people over 65 who will be celebrating having walked miles and miles this summer as part of a city program to promote exercise and healthy habits among new york\\'s older population.\\nthe \"senior stroll,\" sponsored by the new york city department for the aging, will bring together 140 walking clubs from throughout the city for a mile-long stroll through fort wadsworth. the clubs, which come together at centers for the aging, churches and nursing homes, provide opportunities not only for a bit of a workout, but also for social interaction.\\nwith nearly one out of every five new yorkers now over age 60, according to the department, the agency has been seeking low-cost ways to keep older residents in shape. having encouraged the creation of walking clubs in the past, officials decided to up the ante this year and add a contest to see how far club members could collectively walk from april through august.\\nharriet stollman, director of the department\\'s health promotion division, calculated the number of steps necessary to cross the boroughs, with 2,000 steps equaling about a mile, and distributed pedometers to clubs. they selected their own walking path, be it on a city street, at a nearby park, or indoors to keep cool. \"seniors want to take care of themselves and maintain their health,\" ms. stollman said. \"they recognize the importance of physical activity, and are willing to get out there and be as active as possible, even if they\\'re using a cane or walker.\"\\nsome groups have amassed an impressive number of steps. the one at the united hindu cultural council senior center in south ozone park, queens, has recorded more than 4.6 million steps, the highest in queens, and an amount that ms. stollman says is equal to crossing the borough one way more than 180 times. at the senior stroll, the team with the most miles from each borough will be recognized for its effort with a certificate and a plaque.\\n\"my philosophy is that everybody should be happy and healthy,\" said chan jamoona, the director of the united hindu center, as she clipped a pedometer to the waistline of sookia ramshoi\\'s marshmallow peep-yellow dress. ms. jamoona, who is also a nurse, ushered ms. ramshoi, 74, and the other 80 members of the center\\'s walking club outside, and with an authority that was half drill sergeant, half kindergarten line leader, led the walkers down rockaway boulevard. walking two by two, the walkers stretched back nearly a block, laughing and singing as their neighbors waved hello.\\nthe group, most of whose members are in their 70\\'s, takes to the streets three or four times a week, usually for a few blocks. \"i have a bad knee, but since i\\'ve been coming here, i feel much better,\" said phulbas swebans, 75. ms. swebans has diabetes, but she said the walking sessions had lessened her need for blood sugar medication and lowered her blood pressure. she now takes yoga classes at the center and has been trained as an instructor. \"it\\'s for my own health and benefit,\" she said. \"you have to look after no. 1.\"\\nanother regular

jones senior center in williamsburg, brooklyn, are using the strolls to explore their neighborhoods and share their own history tours.\\n\"they see the changes in the neighborhood and all the new development,\" said narcisa ruiz, the program director at the jones center. \"as we go by broadway and kent avenue, or by peter luger\\'s, for example, they remind each other how it used to be when they were younger, and start telling you stories.\"\\nthe relationships formed within the walking groups can be just as important as the physical benefits, ms. stollman said.\\n\"a lot of seniors

'', 'back in 1998, bedford avenue had no cheery muffin store. the main drag of williamsburg, brooklyn, was, however, home to a growing number of galleries, plenty of illegal residential lofts and an incipient chorus of complaints over the nighttime din outside musty local bars. the dream of an edgy williamsburg was young and alive. and when a young couple started a small wholesale bag-making business on bedford avenue, the effort seemed perfectly in step with broader trends in the area.\\non thursday night, the business, known as brooklyn industries, reached a milestone of sorts. at its store on bedford avenue at north eighth street, devotees of brooklyn industries gathered for a retrospective to honor its artistic vision, which is now in display at six retail locations and on a thriving web site. the williamsburg to be seen outside the flagship store has changed; it is characterized by strollers, people in business attire and little dogs on leashes. but at least at this event, the same doses of hair dye and irony that made the area famous in recent years were in full view.\\n\"now it\\'s a party,\" said a young woman, her short hair bleached three-fourths white and one-fourth a very strident brown, as the beat of a laconic reggae song grew louder. along the store\\'s north wall there stood a giant display depicting a timeline of brooklyn industries\\' t-shirt designs through the ages.\\n\"it\\'s urban culture, sort of street wear in general,\" said paul cochran, a 25-year-old designer who knew of the store\\'s reputation even before he moved to brooklyn from cincinnati last year. once in town, mr. cochran hastened to view in person the store\\'s endless assortment of bags, jeans, jackets, skirts and especially t-shirts -- everywhere t-shirts.\\nas the party swelled, young men and women wearing serious expressions and winter hats and scarves nibbled cheese and cookies; others in dreadlocks and faux-hawks sipped white wine from plastic cups. young children, a newer addition to the neighborhood, jumped onto camouflage-colored chairs and huddled over a game boy.\\nthe shirts on display, a sort of greatest-hits collection, included messages both local (\"save the g train,\" \"the kings county\"); spanish (\"revolt brooklyn!\"); and international (\"cuba libre,\" featuring an image of castro in a threatening pose). some newer designs were more abstract in message; one from last year depicted a tranquil-looking woman sitting on the back of a grimacing man, both of them clothed.\\nthe store\\'s co-founders, lexy funk and vahap avsar, circulated through the crowd, chatting with customers, designers and employees as the band death from above 1979 blared from the stereo.\\nwhen the couple first met in the late 1990\\'s at an artists\\' residence program upstate, it is unlikely that they imagined they would become the grande dame and grand homme of williamsburg couture.\\n\"vahap found a billboard in a dumpster one night,\" ms. funk said, explaining how the business began. \"we brought it to our studio, and decided to make a billboard bag out of it. we went to the first trade show we could find and started selling them.\"\\nat the time, the couple were living in manhattan, but they soon occupied a factory at north 15th street and wythe avenue in williamsburg\\'s north end, and under the label crypto started making more bags -- out of used fedex boxes, pieces of felt, anything they could find. some bags fell apart, but people liked them, and soon the couple were producing t-shirts with a brooklyn industries logo.\\nat the time, the scene on bedford avenue was in its infancy. \"it was a few little cafes and a few clothing stores,\" said matt wood, who designed many of the t-shirts to be seen at the party. \"now i come back here, and there\\'s stuff everywhere.\"\\nin those spare first months and years, mr. avsar and ms. funk lived above the factory, and sold items only wholesale. but they soon decided to open their own shop in 2000, in a 300-square-foot space on bedford avenue. sales grew, and after the sept. 11 attacks, the couple decided to end their wholesale business and focus only on retailing brooklyn industries goods. a mini-empire was born.\\nas the party continued, longtime customers reflected on how their neighborhood has evolved.\\n\"it\\'s turning into a mini-village,\" complained tatiana ardila, 20, who grew up in williamsburg and works at starbucks. her companion, michal dulski, also 20 and a graphic designer, looked around at the shop and remembered its past.\\n\"originally when this store started, it was pretty plain,\" said mr. dulski, who was wearing a gray ski jacket, a brooklyn industries computer bag and a sheen of stubble. while the pressed-tin walls used to be lined with a minimalist display of shirts and bags, the racks and shelves now burst forth with an array of garments in understated yellows, browns and greens. the neighborhood, too, has expanded, so much so, mr. dulski predicted, that on the next shirt \"they\\'ll probably have to put in a couple of high-rises.\"\\nyet some of the t-shirts pay homage to the williamsburg that is not new. leonora russo, known by many as the mayor of williamsburg, is shown on a white t-shirt in two photos: one of her as a 19-year-old model, the other of her many decades later. her 19-year-old self paid $25 a month in rent and was the object of so much attention on the street that she caused car crashes on bedford avenue.\\n\"that\\'s when the streets went both ways,\" said ms. russo, who this evening was wearing a brown fur coat, a sequined beret and the same tinted windshield glasses she wears on her t-shirt. she had been a shopper at the store when mr. wood, the designer, decided to immortalize her in cotton. now she sees her own face -- her faces, really -- everywhere.\\nat the party, in between telling old stories, ms. russo took customers by the hand over to the display and pointed to the shirt with her cane, all pride and radiance. \"you gotta buy one and sleep in it,\" she said, possibly winking. \"pretend i\\'m in your arms.\"\\n', 'on a rainy winter afternoon, just a few minutes after running over a stray hubcap, just after having to pull his beat-up toyota sedan off a beat-up section of the beat-up brooklyn-queens expressway and having to run the little white car back and forth until at last the hubcap broke free, tom le, choreographer-turned-real-estate-agent, re-enters the mad rush of the highway and a mile or so later exits as planned, ending up on a detour, park avenue. \"i\\'m running a little late,\" he says, semicalmly, into his cellphone.\\nthis park avenue, by the way, is no park avenue. this park avenue runs through the bedford-stuyvesant neighborhood of brooklyn, passing soot-covered stores, forgotten (for the moment, anyway) tenements, forlorn housing projects, factories that may or may not be empty, auto-repair shops and hasidic women pushing strollers. this is the park avenue that -- as the sky now begins to pour, as the broken-up streets flood with oil-slicked water -- lands tom le, a corcoran group realtor, at the intersection of central and evergreen, in a vista of plumbing-supply stores and fenced-in yards that is neither central nor green.\\nthen he parks, locks, dashes into an old storefront, so that he is suddenly the tiniest bit overdressed, a tinge too businesslike for the all-of-the-sudden hip environs. brushing off his navy blue blazer and straightening his rain-soaked red tie, he orders a carrot-ginger soup, and a high-energy smile breaks across his face like a banner unfurling. with an accent that is part californian, part vietnamese, part top-selling real-estate agent, he asks rhetorically, \"isn\\'t this great?\"\\nby this he means bushwick, the next new neighborhood or, more precisely, a neighborhood that is now in the sights of new york city real-estate agents and developers as the next new neighborhood. this is bushwick as seen from the banquette at life caf\\xc3\\xa9 nine 83, a cool place with mostly comfort food (meatloaf, fried chicken) and a few vegan options. there is also a new late-night menu, now that people in the neighborhood have started staying in the neighborhood on saturday nights.\\nbefore the late-night menu, they went to the lower east side, for instance, where the first life caf\\xc3\\xa9 opened, back when that was the next neighborhood, in the 80\\'s. or they went to williamsburg (the next neighborhood of the mid-90\\'s), which, of course, they still do, williamsburg only being a couple of stops away on the l train. the point is that an early stage of next-neighborhood development happens when the people who have most recently moved in begin to recreate there the place that they either wanted to be in originally or that rent increases moved them out of. it\\'s sometimes tough to distinguish, especially now when the next-neighborhood cycles seem to be picking up speed, when people are beginning to be kicked out of neighborhoods their demographic equals haven\\'t even heard about yet.\\nthough people are now hearing about bushwick. \"the neighborhood\\'s definitely, as they call it, up and coming,\" says roody hyacinthe, an agent with fillmore real estate who sells in brooklyn. \"i remember two or three years ago, when houses were coming on the market, we were giving them away.\" they\\'re not giving them away anymore.\\n\"you will see,\" says le.\\nnaturally for tom le, as for real-estate agents and real-estate buyers and renters everywhere, bushwick\\'s hotness is, first of all, about location. and in new york, location starts out as having to do with subway lines -- in this case the l train. the l train is connected to manhattan, the island from which even next neighborhoods still ultimately derive their nextness, but in the case of bushwick, the l train is the train that connects it to past next neighborhoods -- i.e., the lower east side and williamsburg. (until very, very recently, parts of bushwick were referred to in real-estate listings as \"east williamsburg,\" sometimes when it is east williamsburg, sometimes when it isn\\'t really because it\\'s really bushwick.)\\nbushwick is roughly the shape of vermont. williamsburg is its neighbor to the north. on its west is bed-stuy, a neighborhood that, given the rising prices in clinton hill, the adjacent neighborhood heading farther west, toward manhattan, is also something of a next neighborhood. (see also the port morris and mott haven neighborhoods in the bronx.) on bushwick\\'s eastern border is ridgewood, in queens -- ridgewood, in turn, being bordered by vast plots of parklike green that, at the moment, are zoned only for the dead.\\nafter location in the real-estate hotness calculus comes price, and in bushwick the price is right -- i.e., low, or pretty low, as far as new york goes. rents, which are rising, are around $1,400 for 1,200 square feet, at the moment -- about half what they are in dumbo, which was a next neighborhood six or seven years ago, and perhaps at a third of what they are on the lower east side. likewise, a half-million dollars won\\'t get your phone call returned by real-estate agents in manhattan, where the average apartment now sells for more than a million. but in bushwick, half a million dollars can still get you a small single-family home (or could have before this article appeared). as le says, continuing his lunch-table neighborhood tour, \"this hasn\\'t yet been discovered.\" and by this he still means bushwick.\\nas with exploration in the renaissance, discovered in new york real estate is a problematic concept. the old building directly across the street from life caf\\xc3\\xa9 is owned by the baierlein family, whose ancestors have been there since around the time mayor mcclellan was elected mayor in 1903, since the first subways opened, since the williamsburg bridge was built and since o. henry wrote his new york stories. the baierleins are a remnant of the german population that came to the little village of bushwick in the mid-1800\\'s, the immigrant group that built the breweries of brooklyn. in the 1920\\'s, after the germans discovered bushwick, it was discovered by italians. after world war ii, when the italians moved to the suburbs, bushwick was discovered by puerto ricans. during the city\\'s fiscal crisis, the last german breweries closed, and then riots during the blackout of 1977 nearly destroyed the neighborhood completely; by then, the baierleins had boarded up their apartments to protect them from the fires that were raging through what was becoming a neighborhood of abandoned lots. bushwick was discovered yet again in the 1980\\'s by new new yorkers from the dominican republic, as well as guyana, ecuador, jamaica, india and china, new immigrants who moved to bushwick not for cool restaurants but to survive in what was a civic wasteland. most recently, in the 10 years before the opening of the life caf\\xc3\\xa9 in 2002, bushwick was discovered by people moving to new york from mexico. bushwick is a dutch word sometimes translated as \"refuge.\"\\nle\\'s discovery of bushwick started when his own friends -- dancers and artists -- moved into lofts in the area in the 90\\'s, lofts with no heat or water or plumbing; they used charcoal barbecues to keep warm. it was then that le was making the transition from dance to real estate, the business of his family in california. he started with fillmore real estate and became a \"top producer,\" to use the industry term. \"i told them to open an office in williamsburg,\" he goes on. \"so when we did, people started coming into the office looking for places. they\\'d say my budget, for example, is $500,000. sadly, with half a million they can\\'t afford williamsburg or east williamsburg.\" and there, by east williamsburg, he means east williamsburg. that\\'s when he mentions the discovery: bushwick. real estate is so often the business of readjusting dreams.\\ntake the couple that showed up not long ago at his office. \"we were looking for williamsburg,\" le says, speaking real-estate-ese, a first-person plural. \"we had $700,000 to spend. one is a sculptor; the other one is also an artist, does installation. and they said, \\'we\\'d love something we could have our studio in,\\' and i said: \\'well, 700 is a lot of money. we can get you a two-family. but for a studio, if you want bigger space, you may have to go farther out.\\' and they said: \\'fine. what do you think you have?\\' at that time, i had a four-family and a store, plus a warehouse in the back. this is just about a year ago. in the back is a huge warehouse with a 20-foot ceiling. they went there, and their mouths -- they just went like: \\'oh, my god! this is great!\\' and they got it for $650,000! it\\'s off of central.\"\\nthe final factor in next-neighborhood hotness has to do with the presence of what might be broadly categorized as artists. in forest succession, leafy hardwoods like alder precede the towering softwoods like pine, and in real estate in new york, it is the artists who arrive first in a neighborhood that is about to change, especially in industrial sites, especially in large old spaces abandoned and left for dead. \"this is the story of real estate,\" le says, \"that the artists are always pioneering.\" it is the story of soho, west chelsea, williamsburg. in this case, the first artists arrived in bushwick in the 90\\'s, when bushwick\\'s factory areas were still burning.\\n\"when i moved in 1991, there was a crack-for-sex trade on my landing,\" says john jasperse. now jasperse is a nationally recognized choreographer who until recently kept his studio for his dance company in bushwick; then, he was a not yet nationally recognized young choreographer who, with three other artists, persuaded a landlord to let them renovate an abandoned loft building. \"basically the reason we were there was because nobody wanted to be there,\" he says.\\n\"it was a war zone,\" says rob herschenfeld, a furniture designer, who in 1996 was feeling pushed out of a rented space in williamsburg. he bought a loft building on boerum street, a place that real-estate agents called east williamsburg a few months ago (and may even be east williamsburg) but is now called bushwick. he did not seek out cafes at the time, not that there were any. \"we were too busy emptying out the crack addicts,\" he says.\\ntorben giehler, a painter, showed up at the end of the 90\\'s, renting a space in herschenfeld\\'s building; herschenfeld\\'s mother and building manager, phyllis, approved a lease when few other people would. \"i couldn\\'t get any credit, and phyllis, she just liked my work and gave me the place,\" he says. he had a view of feral dogs, prostitutes and a guy who shot up heroin while driving and, as a result, ran into a couple of cars.\\ngiehler\\'s friend jeffrey reed, a sculptor and photographer, was there a year or two later in 2,000 square feet of raw space on the side of a construction yard, which he got for $1,200 a month. he found the streets nerve-racking. \"if you saw someone, you would start walking the other way,\" he says. \"you just assumed there wasn\\'t any reason that anyone would be there.\" when reed visited giehler\\'s space at the end of the day, they would look out the window at the view of burning cars. once, as a long stream of gasoline made its way down the street, they suddenly realized that reed\\'s car was about to catch fire, but they managed to run down and move it in time.\\nafter artists came students, also as per the next-neighborhood cycle -- students like cynthia rojas, who moved in 2001, arriving from california, with her husband, brian lease, a classically trained vibraphone player who plays in a band called fisherman\\'s xylophonic burlesque orchestra. for recreation, they went to the laundromat on flushing avenue. \"that was it,\" she says. \"it was like camping.\"\\nthe development of cool places kicked off in 2002, after kathy kirkpatrick, who founded the original life caf\\xc3\\xa9 in the 80\\'s, moved to bushwick, taking the first apartment she saw for rent. \"then i looked out my window,\" she says, \"and i kept seeing hipsters. and then i thought, this looks just like the people who were living in the east village.\" in august 2002, she opened up a restaurant, small, with just a steam table, as well as newspapers and essentials, like onions and toilet paper. \"i didn\\'t realize the desperate desire of the community here to have a place -- the musicians and artists and the writers who needed to get out and hang,\" she says.\\na few months later, kevin lindamood, who had come to bushwick a few years earlier from western virginia, renovated an industrial building and opened a nonprofit arts-oriented space called officeops. there\\'s a movie screening room and a big kitchen for parties, as well as a new thrift shop. sometimes lindamood rents out the roof for weddings and other events. sometimes those events are even attended by williamsburgers.\\nat the end of 2002, herschenfeld built a small grocery store, brooklyn\\'s natural, right near the morgan avenue l stop exit on bogart street, and one of the people working with him opened a bar around the corner, called kings county. (today, a rock-climbing wall decorates the spire of herschenfeld\\'s remodeled warehouse.)\\nsince life caf\\xc3\\xa9 and brooklyn\\'s natural opened, all kinds of artists and performers have come to make bushwick home. in 2003, jonah bokaer, a dancer with merce cunningham, started chez bushwick, a salon for artists and performers in herschenfeld\\'s loft building on boerum. \"it\\'s a very catalytic place,\" bokaer says.\\nfor his part, l.d. beghtol says a kind of artistic critical mass may have been reached that year. beghtol had been living in the baierlein family\\'s apartments since 2000, moving there after five years in downtown manhattan. a village voice art director, he is also a member of several bands and band collectives, like l.d. & the new criticism, and sang on the magnetic fields\\' three-cd song cycle, \"69 love songs.\" one night in 2002, beghtol was in life caf\\xc3\\xa9, having a drink, when a d.j. played the song \"lions\" by tones on tail, what might be called a next-next-neighborhood band. \"i thought, i can\\'t believe i\\'m hearing this in my neighborhood bar,\" beghtol said. the d.j. turned out to be the girlfriend of jim bentley, who had just moved to bushwick from chicago (seeing a likeness to the ukranian village in chicago, where all the musicians hang out). bentley runs the fort, a neighborhood recording studio, and now labels the projects he produces with beghtol and others with the stamp \"made in bushwick.\" \"there\\'s a lot going on here that hasn\\'t hit the airwaves, but it will,\" beghtol says.\\nnext-neighborhood development has now reached a pivotal juncture in bushwick. the area still won\\'t be mistaken for the upper west side or even williamsburg. there is no giant luxury supermarket; there are no dry cleaners in the warehouse district, and not many anyplace else. crime is still bad, or really bad (the rates of violent crime are still among the highest in the city) -- last year, the local precinct reported 15 murders, 40 rapes, 467 robberies and 399 felonious assaults. and while there may not be as many cars burning in the warehouse district as there used to be, the streets still feel desolate.\\nbut bushwick is now definitely in the next stage. in may 2004, the neighborhood got its first video store-cafe, the archive. northeast kingdom, the latest artist-affiliated restaurant, opened in october 2005, started by two vermont natives currently living in williamsburg proper. in the past year, luxury condos started showing up for $400,000. and there is even a festival -- a festival that uses an acronym, acronyms seeming to be the linchpin of the real-estate business. late last summer, ruth garon, who coordinates arts events, arrived in bushwick for the very first time, after moving from tel aviv to manhattan. \"i was having a crisis with new york,\" she says. \"and it was the first time i felt a sort of community.\" four months later, she was inspired to organize the bushwick art project, or bap, a neighborhood happening of video v.j.\\'s and d.j.\\'s and film and dance and live music. each time garon held a meeting in her cook street loft, she noticed that more and more artists came. she also noticed that local residents began to resist an art festival. \"some people were suspicious, and they said the people from manhattan will come and everything will be expensive,\" she recalls. \"but after a while, they saw that we were working from a pure place.\"\\nperhaps those most affected by a neighborhood\\'s nextness are the people who are already living there, the people who have been living there for years and are not necessarily looking for a place to install a video-dance piece but are trying to live, maybe even raise children. in this case, these are the people living in what a real-estate agent might at this moment be calling deep bushwick, that place with tired but well-swept row houses along knickerbocker avenue or in and around wyckoff avenue, another old commercial strip. if you follow tom le as he tours around bushwick in his car, he will stop you on a street of two-family row houses and get out and point around and say how great they are, as investment opportunities. \"one of the most wonderful things about bushwick is that it is a wonderful established family neighborhood,\" he says. \"you can drive up and down the streets in bushwick and you see families out there.\"\\nthis neighborhood of families survives on some of the lowest incomes in the city; bushwick\\'s median household income is about $22,000. one-fifth of the neighborhood is on public assistance. bushwick also has foreclosure rates four times higher than the city average. meanwhile, almost 40 percent of the neighborhood pay more than 60 percent of their incomes on housing, according to a report by the furman center for real estate and urban policy at new york university. a neighborhood survey found that 69 percent live with cockroaches, 47 percent with rats or mice, 30 percent with mold; the rate of hospital visits for asthma is four times the city average. sometimes -- for people who are not on public assistance and live in a city where the highest-earning families have nine times the income of the lowest -- the rising rents are pushing tenants to buy homes they can\\'t afford.\\nangel vera has lived in bushwick for 14 years. originally from ecuador, he is an organizer with a community group called make the road by walking, on grove street, near the intersection of myrtle and broadway -- an area that was nearly destroyed during the rioting and looting of the citywide blackout in 1977. last year, make the road organized the workers at discount-sneaker and apparel stores to get them the minimum wage and benefits. still, the neighborhood feels on the verge: a little latin american music store is closed, and the local credit union almost got priced out of an affordable office. construction workers carry new sheetrock into recently emptied apartments. \"there are a lot of landlords who are evicting whole buildings lately,\" vera says. \"people move here because somewhere else is more expensive. that\\'s the system. this automatically puts low-income people in danger.\"\\nbut it\\'s not just the low-income people. maybe it\\'s because the next-neighborhood cycle turns so quickly now or maybe it was always the case, but in the bushwick that is about to happen, artists are already being kicked out, before more than even a handful of new home buyers get to live alongside them. \"it begs the question, is new york just going to consume itself?\" says john jasperse, who was kicked out of his loft space last year when his landlord began to convert his studio space into condos. \"because the identity of it as a place of cultural expression seems less and less possible. i\\'ve really seen the ecology of the place change. and, yes, it\\'s safer and it\\'s cleaner, and, yeah, there are some individual artists who are really fighting the fight. but they\\'re also getting slammed, and you can\\'t expect that the fight is going to constantly repeat itself. it\\'s going to take some kind of responsible developer or some action by the government, because we can\\'t just be making money, money, money. if it\\'s just left to market economics, then everywhere is just going to be brokers on wall street.\"\\nback at lunch, tom le works to keep things positive. \"there\\'s that horrible word, gentrification, but it\\'s not all bad,\" he says. and he talks about his own plan to assuage the harshness of the market, which is mostly a plan for assuaging the hardships on artists. he dreams of helping artists invest in real estate, of opening an artists\\' studio in bushwick himself, with an upstate affiliate perhaps. he speaks of the trends in terms of unstoppable natural forces. \"the machine keeps going,\" he says, \"and it\\'s not the developers, it\\'s not the realtors. it\\'s the demand that keeps the machine going, and you have to invest so that you are ready when the next transformation occurs. we can ride the wave or get kicked out.\"\\nbut mostly le talks about how things are really happening in the neighborhood, pricewise. on the weekend, he will run an ad: \"vacant 6-family in bushwick, brownstone 26 x 70, 1 block from train and shopping in the next hot neighborhood, ideal development or condo conversion. $849k.\"\\n\"three or six people can come in there, renovate it and have a wonderful community there,\" he says. \"it\\'s on bushwick, right off broadway, which is great.\"\\neven in the past few weeks, housing prices in the neighborhood have increased. buildings are even flipping. le sold a building on chauncey street, off beat-up bushwick avenue, for $500,000, which the owner bought for just over $300,000 a year or so ago. and then there are the condo conversions -- a 16-unit condo conversion off central avenue, a few subway stops from williamsburg and just a few minutes from manhattan, with private parking and outdoor space at $400 a square foot -- a real deal, even if prospective buyers might be a little nervous when they first see it, at least until they see the video store and the place to buy organic yogurt.\\nafter he finished his soup, le set off to see a client. but he e-mailed later to check in, because since he left dance, real estate is, as he says, \"my life seven days a week.\"\\n\"as you can see, bushwick is very dynamic,\" he wrote. \"should you need any more assistance or you are ever in need to chat about exciting new neighborhoods or to discuss new places to hang out, please don\\'t hesitate to give me a shout.\"\\nthe next neighborhood robert sullivan is the author of \"rats: observations on the history and habitat of the city\\'s most unwanted inhabitants\" and \"how not to get rich: why being bad off isn\\'t so bad.\"\\n', '', 'explosions boomed through a quiet area of downtown brooklyn yesterday afternoon after propane tanks ignited during roof work atop a police precinct house, sending the metal tubes sailing like missiles into the streets below, the police said.\\nno one was injured in the explosions or the brief but spectacular fire that followed. a thick column of ink-black smoke stopped sunday strollers on the sidewalks. those closest to the precinct house ran into a mcdonald\\'s restaurant at tillary and gold streets.\\nmykel foreman, 12, who lives nearby, saw and heard the blast. his mother was on the telephone with a 911 operator when the second explosion occurred, he said. his own first fears were dark: \"i thought it was like the terrorists had attacked again, like it was a bomb.\"\\nthe explosions occurred at 3:11 p.m. above the 84th precinct station, which shares the building at 301 gold street with the firehouse for ladder 110 and engine 207. firefighters and police officers evacuated the building, and the fire brought a two-alarm response of more than 100 firefighters. the blaze was quickly extinguished, and a breeze soon cleared away the smoke.  the fire was brought under control at 3:48 p.m., the fire department said.\\nthe roofers spoke with fire investigators and police officials outside the building. the workers\\' clothes were darkened with grime and soot, but they otherwise appeared unharmed.\\nfive workers with a company called sca asbestos removal were tarring the roof when the tanks exploded, the police said. two tanks sailed onto prince street, one of them landing on the off-ramp of the brooklyn-queens expressway, large enough to have done great damage to a person or vehicle, but landing on the pavement without injuring anyone. one tank landed on tillary, a busy thoroughfare any day of the week, but quietest on sunday.\\nsurrounding blocks and the expressway exit remained closed for hours yesterday afternoon.\\nparamedics leaned on their empty stretchers. department of environmental protection and department of buildings officials were inspecting the building yesterday afternoon for asbestos and structural damage before allowing anyone back inside, the police said. later, the department of buildings deemed the buildings \"uncompromised.\"\\nenvironmental tests for asbestos were pending yesterday evening, said charles sturcken, an environmental protection department spokesman.\\ntwo members of the shomrim community watch patrol, a hasidic group in williamsburg, saw the explosion from their window. \"it was very, very powerful, the flames,\" said one of the men, who gave his name as jacob. \"there was a loud explosion, a ball of fire coming up.\"\\n', 'on almost any given sunday, the trumpeter john mcneil walks out of his apartment and down a few tree-lined blocks to night and day, a bistro on fifth avenue in park slope. since february, mr. mcneil has held a weekly gig in a rear annex of the restaurant with a quartet he formed with the tenor saxophonist bill mchenry. a hangout for neighborhood residents and a magnet for musicians, the engagement has become a fixture of brooklyn\\'s rich and booming jazz scene.\\nthe rise of that scene \\xe2\\x80\\x94 which, like its borough, is an assemblage of enclaves \\xe2\\x80\\x94 has been one of the most significant developments for jazz in new york in recent years. (every bit as significant as the brooklyn rock explosion of a few years ago, with which it shouldn\\'t be confused.) through a growing network of low-rent spaces mostly booked by enterprising musicians, brooklyn has assumed a vital role in the city\\'s larger jazz culture. and the music has been a boon for listeners of all kinds, including those who have to cross the east river to hear it.\\nto his great delight, mr. mcneil barely has to cross the street. \"i\\'ve lived here since the early 1970\\'s,\" he said one sunday, between sets at night and day. for a long time he was one of many brooklyn jazz citizens who had to travel to manhattan for staples of employment and entertainment. many musicians still make that commute, occasionally to perform at marquee clubs like the blue note and the village vanguard, but more often to hold court in small rooms like the 55 bar, fat cat and the cornelia street caf\\xc3\\xa9, which is owned by robin hirsch, one of two partners behind night and day.\\nin a sense brooklyn\\'s jazz clubs operate on the same plane as those west village bars. (it\\'s not uncommon for a group to play one night at the 55 bar and the next at a spot in brooklyn.) the difference between the two scenes, in terms of audience, is outlined succinctly by mr. hirsch, based on firsthand expertise: \"the village will draw an international crowd, while park slope is strictly local.\"\\ncertainly the crowd is overwhelmingly local at tea lounge on union street in park slope. walk into the cavernous coffeehouse on a thursday or friday night, and you\\'ll probably spot a few strollers nestled among the couches, along with laptop computers and stylish casual attire. you\\'ll also see adventurous young jazz musicians playing for tips, since tea lounge doesn\\'t have a cover charge.\\nthat policy attracts an audience more random and robust than the musicians might otherwise hope to reach, especially in manhattan. this winter the alto saxophonist andrew d\\'angelo played one show to more than 100 people, a large crowd for an avant-garde jazz show. some of the listeners  paid a suggested donation; others merely paid attention. oren arnon, who books the room, recently pegged its vibe: \"a combination of quality jazz and something social, which doesn\\'t happen often enough in this city.\"\\na similar ethos prevails at barb\\xc3\\xa8s, universally acknowledged as the vanguard (village vanguard, even) of the new brooklyn jazz  scene. \"we tried to build a no-pressure environment for audiences and musicians,\" said olivier conan, who owns the bar with a fellow french expatriate and musician, vincent douglas. the club\\'s success confirms the wisdom of that premise.\\nbarb\\xc3\\xa8s may be the place most responsible for the perception of a brooklyn jazz renaissance. its cozy dimensions suit small audiences and rapt attention. and its booking describes a rough bouquet of sounds: from french musette to brazilian forr\\xc3\\xb3, as well as  multiple strains of jazz, from gypsy swing to collective free improvisation.\\nlong-term residencies, hardly a staple in manhattan, are a prominent feature of the programming at barb\\xc3\\xa8s. the violinist jenny scheinman usually plays on tuesday nights, seasoning her music with flecks of jazz, classical and rustic folk. wednesdays are devoted to an avant-garde series organized by the saxophonist micha\\xc3\\xabl attias. (he isn\\'t the only musician maintaining a series in the area; six blocks south, the keyboardist james carney books sunday nights at bar 4, a red-lighted dive.)\\nlast month the clarinetist and saxophonist chris speed started skirl, an independent record label with the express purpose of documenting some of the experimental artists in the regular barb\\xc3\\xa8s orbit. the label\\'s next release party is scheduled for thursday at the club.\\nexperimentation and eclecticism are hardly limited to park slope. in williamsburg they converge at rose live music, a stylish lounge on grand street that opened just a few months ago. they come together even more explicitly during the williamsburg jazz festival, which will have its fourth season in september.\\nbut nothing beats the neighborhood\\'s leading spot, zebulon caf\\xc3\\xa9 concert, which combines the flea-market chic of barb\\xc3\\xa8s (the owners, guillaume blestel and jef and jocelyn soubiran, are french) with the no-cover rule of tea lounge (but with one significant distinction: every artist receives a guarantee). zebulon\\'s programming has lately leaned markedly toward world music, but the free-jazz violinist billy bang has made notable appearances, as has the composer and conductor butch morris.\\nmr. morris also helped inaugurate a more extreme outpost, the nonprofit issue project room, when it relocated last june from the east village into a silo on the gowanus canal. \"the industrial environment tends to inspire a rugged sort of experimentation,\" said suzanne fiol, the organization\\'s director, hours before a recent premiere by the japanese composer shoko nagai.\\nrugged experimentation of a different sort was one hallmark of the jazz scene in brooklyn during its original heyday, from the late 1950\\'s through the 60\\'s. throughout those years a cluster of african-american establishments thrived around fulton street and nostrand avenue.\\none of them, the blue coronet, served as a laboratory for youngbloods like the tenor saxophonist wayne shorter and the trumpeter freddie hubbard. another was immortalized by mr. hubbard with a 1965 blue note album called \"the night of the cookers: live at club la marchal,\" on which he locked horns with lee morgan in a casual but heated exchange.\\n\"going back to 1960, there was something loosely called a brooklyn sound,\" said robert myers, referring in part to that album. \"and it started with the venues, which gave the musicians license to explore new avenues onstage and not be confined by management.\" until the close of 2004 mr. myers operated up over jazz caf\\xc3\\xa9, a bar on flatbush avenue that fulfilled a similar function for the latest generation of post-bop strivers, like the tenor saxophonist marcus strickland and the pianist robert glasper.\\nmr. glasper provides an illustrative example of the current brooklyn-manhattan jazz symbiosis. he arrived in the city at the tail end of the 1990\\'s, settling in brooklyn but matriculating at the new school university in manhattan. he quickly plugged into a circuit of jam sessions stretching from freddy\\'s backroom, on dean street in park slope, to smalls, a crucible of young talent in greenwich village.\\nat up over jazz he found steady work and a space to hone his craft. but after he earned the imprimatur of a blue note records contract, his next career move was clear: a week at the village vanguard. (he concludes his second engagement there this weekend with his trio.)\\nmr. glasper\\'s example also illustrates the existence of a parallel brooklyn jazz movement among african-americans in bedford-stuyvesant, fort greene and clinton hill. self-consciously styled as a revival of brooklyn\\'s golden era, this scene includes institutions like jazz 966, a series held for the last 16 years at the fort greene senior citizens council; 651 arts, a nonprofit concert presenting organization; and the concord baptist church, which holds occasional jazz services. in april a consortium of these and other groups mounted the seventh annual central brooklyn jazz festival, with \"jazz: a music of the spirit\" as its theme.\\nthe author of that theme, the trumpeter  ahmed abdullah, was a visible presence during the festival, especially at sista\\'s place, a communally owned coffeehouse and salon in bedford-stuyvesant. \"african-americans have rarely owned the music\\'s means of production,\" he said in a phone conversation. \"the music has to be in our community if it\\'s going to grow. we\\'ve got to have an alternative to mainstream institutions.\"\\nthe crowd that packed sista\\'s place one rainy saturday for a festival performance by the trumpeter charles tolliver made it look as if mr. abdullah\\'s objective was being fulfilled. less expectedly, his words seemed nearly as pertinent to a performance held on the same night at the center for improvisational music, or cim, a nonprofit educational effort run by the trumpeter ralph alessi near the northern stretch of the gowanus canal.\\nit featured the alto saxophonist tim berne, one of the early homesteaders of the newly ascendant brooklyn jazz community. mr. berne long ago claimed ownership of his music\\'s means of production with a self-sustaining record label based in a brownstone near flatbush avenue. and he has spent most of his career on the alternative fringe of jazz culture, though his audience at cim included a couple of industry veterans like jeff levenson, who has a working affiliation with the blue note, one of new york\\'s most obvious mainstream jazz institutions.\\n\"brooklyn is essentially an incubator, where a lot of things get messed with and hybridized,\" mr. levenson said later, speaking as an almost 30-year resident of the borough. \"i think an audience approaches that experience differently than the audience that comes to the blue note. there\\'s a different agenda, a different motivation. we\\'re talking works in progress, which moderates the expectation levels.\"\\na good many brooklyn musicians would agree with that characterization, which casts the borough\\'s jazz scene almost in the role of a loose-and-limber triple-a  baseball team. (higher in the pecking order than the class a brooklyn cyclones, anyway.) but the idea probably wouldn\\'t sit well with mr. abdullah, who sees community-based creative action as a goal in itself.\\nnor for different reasons would it agree with the percussionist matt moran, who leads slavic soul party, an improviser-stocked balkan brass band that performs on tuesdays at barb\\xc3\\xa8s, after ms. scheinman. \"maybe this started out as a place where people workshop things,\" mr. moran said outside the club recently, between sets. \"but it\\'s on the radar now, and you need to step up and present your work in the best possible light.\"\\n\"it has really arrived as a scene,\" he continued, gathering steam. \"people are saying, \\'i\\'m not going to step into the shininess of manhattan, i\\'m going to do it in my own earthy way.\\' and rather than struggling in obscurity, they\\'re finding that now it\\'s a celebrated thing.\"\\n', 'miguel hern\\xc3\\x81ndez of ossining is the only hispanic mayor in  new york state, though  that distinction took effect early this month and will last only until year\\'s end.\\nstill, what a statement those seven months will be about how polychrome cheever country has become. most americans still think of westchester as white, and white bread, except when an urban anomaly like yonkers conquers that stereotype. but the county, like the country, turns out to have lots of everything, even in its villages. in ossining, port chester, and sleepy hollow, hispanics are a major force.\\n\"i don\\'t want to make a big deal of it \\xe2\\x80\\x94 it\\'s only a part-time job,\" the unassuming mr. hern\\xc3\\xa1ndez said of the unassuming $12,000-a-year position. \"but it sends a message that the hispanic community is maturing and moving into the mainstream.\"\\nthe county has one hispanic legislator, jos\\xc3\\xa9 i. alvarado of yonkers, and a tier of hispanic movers and shakers like felix sanchez, a lawyer in yonkers; gilbert torres, a financial adviser in white plains; and maria perez, who runs an advertising firm in elmsford. westchesterites are glad that they can table-hop among hispanic cuisines in port chester, but they are becoming aware that hispanic merchants now run lots of shops on whiter village main streets.\\n\"they\\'re the new mom and pop,\" said brian nickerson, director of  pace university\\'s michaelian institute for public policy and management in white plains.\\nin that mix, mr. hern\\xc3\\xa1ndez turns out to be not just another ethnic pol, but an erudite 67-year-old published military historian who drives a mini cooper and is a connoisseur of the croton aqueduct and ossining itself. bet you didn\\'t know this village was first named sing sing but changed its name to distance itself from the big house up the river.\\nmr. hern\\xc3\\xa1ndez, a stocky, mustached man with leonine patches of white hair, reminds you he is mayor, not acting mayor. a democrat, he was chosen from among four village trustees after the elected mayor resigned, and he will have to surrender his job at the end of the year because his party chose another candidate to run for the next two-year term.\\nas a trustee since 2000, he helped arrange a pickup point for day laborers near the community center. but in the short time he has left, he wants to be mayor for all of ossining\\'s 24,000 people, not just its 7,000 hispanics. like many migrants, he has  moved beyond his roots, in his case the coffee-lush mountains of puerto rico and the mean streets of east williamsburg, in brooklyn, where his mother, a factory worker, died when he was 15 and his father, a pipe fitter, when he was 21.\\nhe wants to spruce up main street\\'s fraying gingerbread facades, complete a seven-story apartment building on a once ramshackle waterfront, and build a river walk to let strollers \\xe2\\x80\\x94 not just prison guards \\xe2\\x80\\x94 soak in the hudson river views. he wants to call attention to an ossining gem, the gabled cottage once owned by clement clarke moore, who is credited with the children\\'s poem that begins \" \\'twas the night before christmas.\"\\n\"people think ossining is gritty and urban, and it certainly has that aspect to it, but then there\\'s a neighborhood like this,\" mayor hern\\xc3\\xa1ndez said.\\nhe wants to open two museums, one that capitalizes on sing sing and another centered on immigration.\\n\"we need some place where people can say, \\'my ancestors came here and built this community, and here is the proof,\\' \" he said.\\nsome hispanic migrants settled in small villages like ossining because they grew up in caribbean or latin american villages. others wanted backyards and good schools, like mr. hern\\xc3\\xa1ndez, who left brooklyn in 1981 for an $86,000 house (though he still sprinkles his conversation with new york yiddishisms, as in \"i\\'ll show you the whole megillah\"). just because ossining had many hispanics did not mean he would have much in common with all of them, he likes to emphasize.\\n\"we are different tribes,\" he said. \"the analogy i make is with the brits. we\\'re divided by a common tongue.\"\\nmr. hern\\xc3\\xa1ndez knows about divisions. he worked as a justice department mediator in the 71-day standoff between indians and federal authorities in 1973 at wounded knee, s.d. later, as the executive director of new york city\\'s human rights commission, he negotiated a public-housing settlement between hasidim and puerto ricans in williamsburg.\\nwhen he looks at the engineering marvel of the aqueduct, he recalls that it was built by irishmen who set up camps in places that are now sleepy hollow and ossining and came to dominate those municipalities. the irish of ossining have prospered and are less drawn to politics. but there\\'s a new force of laborers \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and professionals like mr. hern\\xc3\\xa1ndez \\xe2\\x80\\x94 waiting in the wings.\\n', '', 'kiryas joel, n.y., aug. 22 \\xe2\\x80\\x94 as the administrator of this village in southern orange county, gedalye szegedin knows that much of his job revolves around a simple equation: the number of girls who get married is roughly equal to the number of new homes this community will need to accommodate its rapid growth.\\nlast year, mr. szegedin oversaw the construction of 200 houses and apartments, mostly on the outer-lying lots along the eastern edge of this 1.1-square-mile community, an ultra-orthodox jewish enclave about 60 miles north of midtown manhattan. by the end of this year, he said, the village will most likely have 300 new homes.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cthere are three religious tenets that drive our growth: our women don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t use birth control, they get married young and after they get married, they stay in kiryas joel and start a family,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d mr. szegedin said.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cour growth comes simply from the fact that our families have a lot of babies,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he added, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand we need to build homes to respond to the needs of our community.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nbut developable land is a finite resource here, and not much of it is left. and as kiryas joel pushes up against its borders, nearby neighbors in the towns of blooming grove and woodbury are moving aggressively to prevent the community from expanding by incorporating into villages of their own.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cwe still have huge tracts of open land in woodbury, and we want to keep it that way,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said woodbury\\xe2\\x80\\x99s supervisor, john p. burke, who grew up in the bronx and moved to orange county in 1969.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cwe want to make sure that no outside community is able to completely transform the character and the look of our town,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cif we need a village to do that, so be it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nkiryas joel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s population leaped to 18,300 last year from 13,100 in 2000 and 7,400 in 1990, making it one of the fastest growing places in the state, according to the most recent estimates by the census bureau. for two years, developers and local officials have been searching for private parcels in surrounding communities, hoping to expand the village through annexation for the third time since it was incorporated in 1977 as an offshoot of the satmar hasidic sect of williamsburg, brooklyn.\\nafter its incorporation, most of the growth was driven by migration from new york city. but now, new arrivals are mostly babies and grooms coming to marry one of the local women.\\nworried residents in blooming grove, which lies northwest of here, and woodbury, which lies east,  have voted overwhelmingly in the past two months to approve the creation of two new villages. state law allows villages to be established within towns and to set their own zoning regulations, and area officials say the new villages would be able to restrict the multifamily, high-density building that predominates in kiryas joel.\\nmany of the families in those towns also fled the crowded streets of new york city, moving here for the cleaner air, the safer communities and the open spaces, where the closest neighbor may not be so close.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cwe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re hard-working people who decided to move up here to pay less taxes and enjoy the quietness of country,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said garry dugan, a retired new york city detective and the president of the south blooming grove homeowners association, the group that began the drive to create one of the villages.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a shame that it has come to us and them, but we feel like we had to form a village for no reason other than preserving our quality of life,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said mr. dugan, who has lived in blooming grove for 26 years. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthis has nothing to do with their religion.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nit is not the first time that kiryas joel and its neighbors have clashed.\\nover the years, there have been disputes \\xe2\\x80\\x94 over a water pipeline kiryas joel sought to build, for example, and whether the state should pay for a school system for its disabled students. there was also an argument in 1986 when 600 kiryas joel boys refused to board school buses driven by women. (the drivers are now all men.)\\nthe satmar hasidim share what they call a deep mystical connection to kiryas joel. they were led here by their founder, the grand rabbi joel teitelbaum, who saw in it the ideal place for his followers to raise large families away from the influences of the outside world. hence the name of the village, which means town of joel.\\nabout 3,000 families live here, many of them in boxy wood-frame homes built close to one another, with up to a dozen apartments stacked in four floors.\\nthe village has no parks or public playgrounds, so children play with their colorful plastic toys on small front yards.\\na network of sidewalks twirl across the village, so the women, who do not drive, are able to walk to the clinic and supermarket. baby strollers seem to be everywhere: in the lobbies of buildings, on sidewalks, outside the stores.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cthis is a great place to raise our children; it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s easy to keep them away from the distractions of the city,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said judith greenfeld, 34, whose family moved here from williamsburg two decades ago.\\nall but 3 of her 12 siblings live here.\\nmrs. greenfeld and her husband, joseph, 35, have five children, three boys and two girls, ages 3 to 13. the median age is 15, compared with 35 for the nation, according to the 2000 census. the village has one of the lowest median ages among communities nationwide with more than 5,000 residents.\\nthe greenfelds live on a dead-end street, in a third-floor apartment across from a girls\\xe2\\x80\\x99 school. like most families here, they speak more yiddish than english and have no radio, computer or television at home. mr. greenfeld owns a tile shop in monroe, just outside the village borders.\\nhis wife helps him run the business, which makes her a rare exception among kiryas joel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s women, who are married soon after they graduate from high school, work until they give birth to their second child and then become stay-at-home mothers. the men, meanwhile, board yellow school buses every morning and ride to new york city, to jobs in the diamond district or at b & h, the photo and video store near herald square.\\nbecause of the sheer size of the families (the average household here has six people, but it is not uncommon for couples to have 8 or 10 children), and because a vast majority of households subsist on only one salary, 62 percent of the local families live below poverty level and rely heavily on public assistance, which is another sore point among those who live in neighboring communities.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cwe just don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t understand why they have to keep pushing their expansionist ideas on us,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said charles j. bohan, who is the supervisor of the town of blooming grove and a resident of the new village, named south blooming grove.\\non sept. 21, south blooming grove will hold its first election for mayor and for a four-member board of trustees. the state must still certify the results of the vote to create the village in woodbury before elections there can be held.\\nmr. szegedin, kiryas joel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s administrator, said his community was not deterred.\\n\"we have several different developers that want to sell land to kiryas joel, but if they can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do it, we can build up,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwe can change our zoning code to allow high-rise apartments. the creation of these villages are not going to stop the growth in the village of kiryas joel.\"\\nmrs. greenfeld agreed.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cpeople don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t understand the conception of our people, of our religion,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no government or land or any other authority that can stop us from having babies,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said while her husband put out a plate of cheese blintzes, strawberries and sour cream.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cif there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not enough land, families will double up. there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s always going to be room for the new families,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d mrs. greenfeld said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand if i have to slice up my apartment in two, i\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll do it, without doubt or hesitation.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n', 'in new york city, bohemia is determined by real estate: artists gather in raffish neighborhoods where studio space is cheap; the new outposts of culture and consumption they establish make the quarter desirable, thus raising the rents to prohibitive levels; the artists then decamp for the next shabby enclave. starting in the 1960\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, what new yorkers meant by \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdowntown\\xe2\\x80\\x9d shifted from greenwich village to soho to tribeca to the lower east side. but manhattan is a narrow island, and the portion of it dense enough to sustain the feeling of self-enclosure that bohemia requires is quite small. and so, starting in the 1980\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, as rents skyrocketed, downtown began to migrate across the east river to brooklyn.\\nby now, those portions of brooklyn first colonized by fleeing artists have almost completed the cycle of embourgeoisement. williamsburg, the heart of brooklyn\\xe2\\x80\\x99s gallery scene, has been thoroughly tamed by brasseries and boutiques; the kind of artists who aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t yet showing in those galleries are now moving to deepest, darkest queens. but the middle-class householder geography of queens offers too barren a soil for the rooting of a new bohemia. fortunately, there is lots more brooklyn available.\\nthere is, of course, something wishful, or perhaps wistful, about this perpetual hunt for the urban el dorado. a place that can shift around so easily sounds less like a neighborhood than a mentality, or a species of nostalgia. in most of america, after all, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdowntown\\xe2\\x80\\x9d simply means \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe city\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the place where things are close enough to one another that you can walk. but in new york, where every square inch feels urban, downtown is a refuge from \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a repudiation of \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the conventionality of midtown, and mid-everything. downtown is a concept, and perhaps an archaic one.\\nthe idea of bohemia arose with the bourgeois city, against which it defined itself. in the paris of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cla boh\\xc3\\xa8me\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the latin quarter, circa 1830 \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the artist willingly courts starvation and disease as the price of freedom. the poet rodolfo may be giddy as he shovels his manuscript into the fire to keep warm, but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s still the only source of fuel he has. life was scarcely less desperate \\xe2\\x80\\x94 or less delightful \\xe2\\x80\\x94 in the downtown manhattan of 1910, when the poet and propagandist john reed, according to one biographer, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cate in obscure foreign restaurants, talked with the girls who walked the street in \\xe2\\x80\\x98satan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s circus\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and caroused with spanish longshoremen.\\nreed\\xe2\\x80\\x99s latter-day descendants are threatened not by penury but by gentrification. how can bohemia contend with the twin baby stroller? the other day, walking around fort greene, one of brooklyn\\xe2\\x80\\x99s current claimants to downtown cultural status, i stopped at an office building called 80 arts. in the museum of contemporary african diaspora arts, or mocada, which occupies the ground floor, an exhibition of major black artists had just come down. i picked up some fliers from the counter. one, issued by a company called downtown babies, advertised \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccreative play and music classes\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthemed birthday parties\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to be held at mocada. downtown babies \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the end of bohemia as we know it.\\n80 arts had been gutted and renovated as part of a \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccultural district\\xe2\\x80\\x9d established by a \\xe2\\x80\\x9clocal development corporation\\xe2\\x80\\x9d organized around the brooklyn academy of music, the cultural mega-institution of fort greene. here was a planned bohemia \\xe2\\x80\\x94 surely a contradiction in terms. indeed, many locals, and local organizations, had protested the development (as they are now even more loudly protesting the atlantic yards, a nearby mega-project featuring skyscrapers and a basketball stadium to be designed by frank gehry). but mocada owes its presence in fort greene to the cultural district; should the project be fully implemented, a new theater and public library will be built as well.\\nin short, downtown, or the idea of downtown, has become thoroughly implicated in the cultural and economic forces that it once resisted with every ounce of its scruffy integrity. the misfits and longhairs and revolutionaries deemed unassimilable by mainstream culture in john reed\\xe2\\x80\\x99s day are now considered \\xe2\\x80\\x9cedgy\\xe2\\x80\\x9d; and edge, in turn, attracts sneaker stores and bistros and cultural entrepreneurs and even young couples with strollers. the derri\\xc3\\xa8re-garde keeps catching up with the avant-garde; the avant-garde falls prey to its own lurid appeal. if rodolfo\\xe2\\x80\\x99s artist pal marcello were around today, his gallery opening would be catered by absolut.\\nand so the bohemias of yesteryear have gone the way of reed\\xe2\\x80\\x99s spanish longshoremen. but is that so bad? take a walk in fort greene, an ethnically and economically mixed neighborhood with tree-lined blocks of fine brick homes. a block away from 80 arts, beyond the town house that the painter david salle has lavishly rehabilitated, lies the lime-green habana outpost, an eco-friendly cafe where mothers push downtown babies on swings amid racks of folkloric skirts, priced to sell. and then, moving up fulton street, once a commercial swamp, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the wine store and the soul-food restaurant and the beloved cake man raven. a few blocks away stands the brooklyn academy of music, which has been irreproachably avant-garde since long before there was any money in it. fort greene feels less like bohemia than what the scholar joel kotkin calls an \\xe2\\x80\\x9celite urban enclave\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a place suited to the sophisticated tastes of the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cknowledge workers\\xe2\\x80\\x9d who now propel new york\\xe2\\x80\\x99s economy.\\nbut the wheel of development that brought in those young cosmopolites, and priced out a number of the area\\xe2\\x80\\x99s longtime, predominantly black residents, has not stopped turning: the atlantic yards project threatens to disrupt fort greene\\xe2\\x80\\x99s delicate ecology once again. we want to preserve our precious and beloved utopias like paperweight worlds; but the city \\xe2\\x80\\x94 at least this city \\xe2\\x80\\x94 will not permit it.\\n', 'last week i was trying to find gifts for newborn twins adopted by an architect friend and his graphic designer husband who live in los angeles. they are two new additions to the

that mr. jacobs owns with his brother. in 2005, he put out a couple of cribs in the shop, and after witnessing the rabid response, opened mini jake, which is dedicated to children\\xe2\\x80\\x99s furniture. mini jake soon outgrew the space like training pants, and moved into this 3,000-square-foot warehouse in june.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9ceveryone who was buying dwell and eames chairs suddenly had kids,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d mr. jacobs said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthere was a void to fill.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nwith 20-foot ceilings and two skylights, the light-drenched space is divided into sections that include toys, books, bags, buggies, bedding, newborn essentials and, in the center, a grid of cribs, dressers, rockers and bassinets, all as shiny and presentable as new cars. the store is dustless, colorful and clean-lined \\xe2\\x80\\x94 sort of how i imagine a day care center in copenhagen to look.\\nand, actually, as i walked around the store, i began to notice a predominance of nordic names: flensted mobiles, svan bouncer, a loom from the swedish toy company brio. in the front of the store were pieces of layered foam carved into fish, pig, giraffe and elephant shapes, made by the danish company bobles ($39 each). just now being introduced in the united states, they seem like cooler, chic nerf balls. a box showed a child standing on one of them, with blunt-cut bangs and a fulfilled danish smile.\\ni hovered over the haba kugelbahn ($84.95), a set of troughs and chutes for marbles, which i wanted to tear open and play with on the chalkboard-topped fundy play table ($399.95). then i spent a long time marveling over the antquarium ($24.99), an ant farm filled with a clear gel so you can fully see your pet insects at work. everything was so spotless and clever, it made all the detritus i grew up with \\xe2\\x80\\x94 plastic highchairs, legos, fisher-price toys, awkward potty seats \\xe2\\x80\\x94 look like clunky artifacts from a primitive culture.\\nit was surprisingly quiet when i was there. two fashionable mothers sauntered around, their children comatose in strollers. one woman was in a trendy lime-green sack dress with her long hair loosely bunched up in the back. she roamed around the diaper bags with the same focus she had probably given to a pair of jimmy choo slingbacks 10 years earlier.\\none contraption that caught my eye was the stokke xplory stroller, which has an elevated seat and a horizontal bed for a baby. intended tor lift your children away from the street and place them  closer to you, the stroller looks like an overdesigned lunch cart. according to the mini jake web site, the design is also meant to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cstimulate the all important social interaction between parent and child,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d thus promoting bonding.\\nthe complete stroller, which includes an attachable bassinet, costs $999. it is the most expensive stroller in the store, even more expensive than the notorious bugaboo frog, which at $759 transformed the industry when it appeared on the market in 1999, rejiggering the price point for the simple stroller much like starbucks normalized the $2 coffee.\\nnot all of the products here are from northern europe. of the eight cribs displayed on the floor, four are made by local designers, including one from oeuf in brooklyn ($824 for birch) that can transform into a toddler bed if you buy the $202 conversion kit. supposedly this makes the child\\xe2\\x80\\x99s transition from crib to a first bed less upsetting, giving parents a better chance at catching a bit more sleep.\\nmany of the pricey items here justify themselves by purporting to be adaptable as your child grows: bassinet to buggy, crib to bed. one of the odder looking pieces was the cocoon from the phil & teds line ($59.95). the thick, bright green insulated bag is used to transport your baby but looks disturbingly like a beer cooler.\\ndespite all of this selective high-tech merchandise, mr. jacobs is not at all the design snob you might assume he would be. there may be items here that give you sticker shock, or wipe out your child\\xe2\\x80\\x99s college fund before you have even started it, but he and the store give off a good energy. he and ms. rogers have two children \\xe2\\x80\\x94 jackson, 6, and phoebe, 3 \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and mr. jacobs comes off as your normal, honest, mellow dad operating on

of disrespect \\nthis nation has ever seen.\" twenty minutes before the polls \\nclosed, a car full of rowdies whizzed by him, screaming \"kerry \\nwon! kerry won!\" he prayed it couldn\\'t be true, and his prayers \\nwere answered. in the battle between the \"forces of righteousness \\nand unrighteousness,\" the right side had won.\\n\"those few months have had a powerful impact on my life in \\npreparing me for the ministry of political activism,\" he wrote to \\npatrick henry. \"if in any matter i can bring glory to my god and \\nking, may he grant me the grace to do just that.\"\\nit\\'s not just that derek was a missionary\\'s kid and knew how \\nto say the right things. patrick henry prides itself on not being \\nyour run-of-the-mill bible college: it doesn\\'t give automatic preference \\nto mks, who can be just as rotten as any kids. instead the \\nschool takes the measure of its students constantly, probing the \\nnature of each individual\\'s personal relationship with jesus christ \\nwith the care and trepidation of a parent monitoring a fever, or a \\nschoolgirl checking whether you\\'re still her best friend. under \\nthat microscope, derek glowed.\\ngod\\'s voice was like the sound track to the movie of derek\\'s \\nlife, lending texture and meaning to every action. in return, derek \\nthanked god for everything. he thanked him when a seemingly \\nchance meeting led to a great internship at the local republican \\nheadquarters. \"the lord just dropped that one into my lap!\" he \\nthanked him for his mom sending his favorite granola bars, for his \\nsister passing her driving test, for the extra cheese on his turkey \\nsub. he thanked him for his new used car, although it was dark \\npurple and the ac didn\\'t work and the windows seemed to be \\nglued shut. he thanked him for his after-school job at leach\\'s \\nmeats and sweets down the road, where he worked in the chilly \\nback room hacking up raw chickens and grinding up beef to stuff \\ninto their \"famous\" sausages while tolerating the boss\\'s son\\'s endless \\ntracks of ac/dc (\"the worst band in the whole wide world\").\\n\"it\\'s really been a blessing,\" he told me one day as he wiped his \\nknife on an apron streaked with bloodstains.\\nin the year before he left for college, derek had moved down \\nto the basement of his parents\\' house in barberton, six miles \\nsouth of akron. in the evenings, his mom, donna archer, would \\ngo down there to drop off his clean laundry \"and see if he\\'s ready \\nto hit the hay, and i\\'d find him down on his knees praying. as a \\nchristian mom, nothing thrills me more. nobody was watching \\nhim; it\\'s the real thing. he doesn\\'t do it to please us. you can see \\ngod\\'s spirit at work in him.\"\\n\"because of that,\" his mom added, \"i\\'m not worried if he \\nheads into politics.\"\\nfor patrick henry college, derek was a white sheep, the son \\nyou were pretty sure wouldn\\'t roll his eyes at you the minute you \\nturned your head or sneak a cigarette outside his dorm window at \\nnight. the school thought of itself as a training ground for political \\nmissionaries; its founder, michael farris, traveled the country \\nrecruiting conservative christian kids like derek who were \\nbright, politically minded, and itching to be near the president. \\nfarris was aware of the risks of launching them into the cutthroat \\nand dirty world of politics: he could unwittingly turn out to be \\nthe agent of their corruption, involving them in what derek \\nhad once heard described by a pastor as \"an innately wicked endeavor.\" \\nso derek was a particular gem, a boy who, as much as \\nanyone this side of heaven, seemed incorruptible.\\n\"okay. here goes,\" derek said, as he spotted the welcome students \\nsign hanging in founders hall. like most of the kids who \\ngo to patrick henry, derek was homeschooled by his parents all \\nthe way through high school, so college could be a shock. but during \\norientation week the campus still felt warm and familiar, like \\na big homeschool family reunion. the central buildings and dorms \\nwere packed with typically oversized homeschooling families-ten-year-old  \\ngirls pushing strollers, toddlers scrambling after their \\npregnant moms like baby ducks. the little kids were eerily independent \\nand well behaved; they sat in circles on the grass or outside \\nthe cafeteria, playing games or reading the campus maps for \\nfun. the incoming freshmen boys, meanwhile, looked like children \\nplaying the role of adults in a high school play, with crisp \\nwhite polo shirts, new leather computer bags, and their last bits of \\nacne. the girls wore twin sets over their khakis or black slacks, \\nwhich surprised derek\\'s mom. \"okay, this is going to be more casual \\ndress for the girls than i thought,\" said donna, whose daughter \\ngoes to a christian school where skirts are required. but, she \\nadded, \"i\\'m happy for the lack of tattoos and piercings.\"\\na handful of families looked like reenactors lost on their way \\nto colonial williamsburg: mothers in braids carrying babies in \\nbonnets, girls in their best laura ingalls wilder white-collared \\ndresses taking a stroll around the lake-a tableau that made the \\ncampus feel a century-not an hour-away from downtown \\nwashington, d.c. the parking lot was jammed with vans bearing \\nmessages on their bumpers: truth, or bush/cheney, or life. \\none license plate read momof8.\\nderek, who has blue eyes and sharply parted blond hair, already \\nhad business casual down. he was wearing an oxford shirt \\nand khakis and sneakers that looked recently cleaned. like many \\nhomeschooled boys, derek seemed both old and young for his \\nage. if he was in a good mood, he bounced more than walked and \\nwhistled, like dennis without the menace, or an old contented \\npreacher lost in happy thoughts. with his tall frame, gangly arms, \\nand big grin, he was built for stand-up comedy but he was more \\noften straining to seem more serious. he was polite and sometimes \\nabsurdly formal, and when he was talking to an adult and \\nfeeling nervous, he used constructions more appropriate for the \\nwitness stand. (\"yes, ma\\'am, i have been to this campus on two \\nprior occasions.\")\\nthe campus is tiny, less like an ivy league college than like a \\nhollywood set of an old ivy league school, with one main building \\nand several dorms grouped around a lake, all in federalist \\nstyle. the art in founders hall is designed to remind the students \\nthat america was founded as a christian nation-a gallery \\nof portraits of the founding fathers, all copies, leads up the staircase \\nto the picture of patrick henry at the second virginia convention, \\na shaft of light from heaven guiding his speech. \"harvard \\nfor homeschoolers,\" founder michael farris likes to call it, invoking \\nthe harvard of earlier days, whose laws instructed students \\nto \"know god and jesus christ.\"\\nthe last time derek was on campus, his assigned dorm hadn\\'t \\nbeen built yet, and when he saw it, he was impressed. \"so stately,\" \\nhe said, noting the chandelier in the entranceway and the winding \\nstaircase leading up to his room on the second floor. but the \\nfirst thing that struck me about the boys\\' dorms was what was \\nmissing. even during moving week, there were no flip-flops and \\nshorts, because the dress code encourages \"glorifying god with \\nyour appearance.\" there were no ipod speakers perched on \\nanyone\\'s windows, shuffling from beyonc\\xc3\\x88 to coldplay, because \\nitunes lists are monitored and headphones are encouraged. there \\nwere no movie posters zeroing in on scarlett johansson\\'s cleavage, \\nand no live cleavage either, because girls are required to \\ncover their chests and, in any event, girls aren\\'t allowed in boys\\' \\ndorms. there was no impatient \"mom, aren\\'t you guys going \\nsomewhere for dinner?\" and no sneaking around to figure out \\nwhere the rush parties were because at patrick henry there are \\nhardly ever parties, and drinking and dancing are not allowed. \\nthere were no heaps of clothes on the floor, or open bags of \\ncheetos. the only thing left blocking the hallway for any amount \\nof time was an ironing board-an ironing board, in a boys\\' dorm!\\nthroughout the year, school administrators conduct room \\nchecks to monitor cleanliness, but derek did not really need that \\nincentive. without any prodding, he set up his room like a republican \\nfelix unger. above his desk he hung a signed bush/ \\ncheney poster (\"to mr. archer, with deepest appreciation for \\nyour support\"), a promotional calendar from the bush campaign, \\nand a postcard of ronald reagan (\"if we ever forget that we are \\none nation under god then we will be a nation gone under.\"). he \\nunpacked his favorite authors-joshua harris, rush limbaugh, \\njohn owen-and his prize possession, a bible bound in black \\nleather that he got when he was twelve, its front cover so worn \\nfrom use that you have to divine the once-gold monogram with \\nyour finger, like the shroud of turin. above his desk sat a woodblock \\ni\\'ve seen in many a republican congressman\\'s office. it read: \\ntrust me.\\nalthough patrick henry has rules about movie watching, \\nsome students keep secret stashes of dvds in their bottom drawers, \\nbut derek brought only one-surf ninjas, a martial arts spoof \\nabout two surfer brothers who discover they are long-lost princes \\nfrom a south china sea island kingdom and use their newly discovered \\nspecial powers to overthrow an evil madman dictator. (\"i \\nenjoy the kind of humor it presents.\") he\\'d seen some movies in \\ntheaters, but not very many. \"you really have to be careful about \\nhow much you consume,\" he said. \"watch one movie now and \\nagain with a bad message, and it will help you know what\\'s going \\non in the culture. but if you have a constant diet of that, that\\'s \\nwhere it gets destructive.\"\\nhe brought only a handful of cds by contemporary christian \\nartists such as steven curtis chapman and mercy me-the kind \\nof syrupy christian ballads about which the ac/dc-loving boys \\nat leach\\'s had given him endless grief.\\n\"you don\\'t have to be careful when you listen to them,\" said \\ndonna.\\n\"yes,\" derek added, \"the gospel message is clear. unlike some \\nsecular songs, which leave you with an empty feeling.\"\\nderek indulged in excess in only one area, and this, too, he \\ncould trace back to his mom. his closet was bulging with clothes-suit \\npants and jackets and dress shirts and t-shirts and ties. but \\nthis display was not exactly what it seemed. these were hand-me-downs, \\ncollected from an aunt \"with fashionable inklings\" and \\nvarious church-run thrift stores. and while most teenage boys \\nmight find it annoying to be sent to school with plaid vests and suit \\njackets to \"grow into\" and dozens of shirts and ties collected from \\nchurch sales, derek did not see it this way. to him, it was an embarrassment \\nof riches, so much so that he decided to bring it up \\nwith his mom.\\n\"i feel it\\'s a bit flashy, if you will,\" he said. \"i mean, you don\\'t \\nhave to wear something different every single day,\" he added, in a \\ntone that from him counted as defiance.\\n\"well, i\\'m glad you don\\'t have a lack,\" she said. \"it\\'s better \\nnot to wear the same thing over and over. girls notice that kind \\nof thing-that kind of lack of hygiene-more than guys.\"\\noutside, the kids were comparing schedules-something \\nnew for homeschoolers used to learning at their family\\'s pace. \\nover and over they recited the freshman routine-\"latin, history, \\nlogic, lit\"-a litany meant to calm them down. derek had \\nbeen warned that students at patrick henry \"study, like, fifteen \\nhours a day,\" that they stay up all night or wake up at 4 a.m. and \\nare generally tightly wound and type a, much more so than he is. \\nhe was pretty sure he could keep up, but some other freshmen \\nalready seemed on the verge of snapping under the pressure.\\n\"i\\'ve been planning my classes for the last year, and now the \\nschedule\\'s not going to work,\" said one girl with a very tight \\nponytail, emerging from a meeting with her adviser.\\nhomeschoolers are not the most obvious raw material for a \\ncollege whose main mission is to train a new generation of christian \\npoliticians. politics, after all, is the most chaotic and social \\nof professions, and many students arrive at patrick henry having \\nnever shared a classroom with anyone other than their siblings. in \\nconservative circles, however, homeschoolers are considered to be \\nsomething of an elite group-rough around the edges but pure in \\ntheir focus, capacity for work, and ideological clarity. the kids \\nat patrick henry were raised advocating for the rights of homeschoolers; \\nduring orientation week, they shared stories of lobbying \\ncongressmen sympathetic to their cause or volunteering for \\ncampaigns. most homeschoolers take field trips to the statehouse \\nthe way public school kids visit the zoo or the pumpkin patch.\\ntheir parents raised them tenderly, not with the intention of \\nsheltering them forever, but of grooming them for their ultimate \\nmission: to \"shape the culture and take back the nation.\" it\\'s a \\nphrase repeated in homeschooling circles like a prayer, or a chant, \\nor a company slogan. it shows up in homeschoolers\\' textbooks \\nand essays and church youth groups; their parents whisper it in \\ntheir ears like a secret destiny: there\\'s a world out there, a lost and \\nfallen world, and you alone can rescue it. derek said it to a reporter \\nwho profiled him in the akron beacon journal during his senior year \\nof high school. his father, mark archer, read deuteronomy to \\nhim and explained how moses never got to enter the promised \\nland; it\\'s the young joshua who would lead the way to salvation.\\n\"if there\\'s any hope in this country, it\\'s from you kids,\" his dad \\ntold him. \"morally, there is so much bad going on in this country. \\nit will be you kids coming out of the homeschooling movement, \\nyour generation, who will do it.\"\\n\"homeschooling does give a hope,\" his mother said, more \\ngently.\\nat school the upperclassmen echoed their parent\\'s voices: \\n\"we\\'re the salt of the earth and it\\'s no good if the salt is kept in a \\nshaker,\" said matthew du mee, one of the school\\'s star graduates.\\n\"it\\'s like training knights,\" said a junior. \"we wear thick armor \\nto make the battle easier. we\\'re not saying we\\'re closer to \\nheaven, but we go above and beyond the call of duty.\"\\nthe world out there, this enemy, was something the freshmen \\nhad seen only in bits and pieces-at summer jobs at 7-elevens, \\nplaying sports at the local high school, or while changing channels. \\ntheir parents might have told them horror stories of drugs \\nand date rape and gay-pride parades, but most of them could \\nhardly imagine what those things might look like. but the patrick \\nhenry freshmen, like nerdy teenage boys everywhere, loved science \\nfiction and its cinematic equivalent-star wars and star trek \\nand ender\\'s game and surf ninjas-stories in which a race of morally \\nand intellectually superior boys must leave their childhood home \\nprematurely to go fight enemies who want to destroy an already-mostly-destroyed \\nnation. and the boys always won in the end. \\nsubstitute hillary clinton for darth vader or the klingons, and \\ntheir destiny suddenly made sense to them.\\ncampus in the first few days of orientation week felt like jedi \\nacademy or battle school in the belt or hogwarts school of \\nwitchcraft and wizardry (if they\\'d been allowed to read harry \\npotter). the boys were suddenly faced with an army of other \\nchosen ones just like them, and they found it discomfiting. \\nthey knew the adults around them were looking for the next \\nnapoleon, the next alexander, or at the very least the next antonin \\nscalia, and they wanted to be it. at the endless series of \\nlunches and dinners under the big white tent, they sized each \\nother up, jockeying for position, and flexing their muscles in \\ncrude and awkward ways. they bragged about their special \\npowers in ways that they would cringe to remember a couple of \\nmonths later.\\nexcerpted from god\\'s harvard by hanna rosin copyright \\xc2\\xa9 2007 by hanna rosin. excerpted by permission. all rights reserved. no part of this excerpt may be reproduced or reprinted without permission in writing from the publisher. excerpts are provided by dial-a-book inc. solely for the personal use of visitors to this web site.\\n', 'these days little children are brought along to places that would have been considered inappropriate a generation ago: four-star restaurants, cocktail parties, rock concerts. but for all the sniping from adults who resent this territorial invasion, the onslaught shows no sign of letting up. in fact, one of its latest flash points is the local bar.\\nwhen the owners of union hall \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a moody, dark-paneled bar and brunch spot in park slope, brooklyn \\xe2\\x80\\x94 recently posted a sign that read \\xe2\\x80\\x9cplease, no strollers\\xe2\\x80\\x9d under another one reading \\xe2\\x80\\x9cno one under 21 admitted,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d they did not see it as a declaration of war with the neighborhood\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sizable population of young parents.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe word gets out that this is a place for baby buggies to go, we end up with 8 to 10 strollers, or 15,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said jim carden, an owner. he explained that the goal was simply to make sure that the preferred transportation for toddlers of the stay-at-home parents who had adopted the lounge as an afternoon hangout would not crowd out the regular patrons.\\nperhaps he underestimated the neighborhood\\xe2\\x80\\x99s vocal and proactive parents. local parenting blogs were soon bristling with denunciations.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cthis was a perfect winter moms\\xe2\\x80\\x99 group place for those of us with infants going stir-crazy,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d wrote one woman on onlytheblogknowsbrooklyn.com, wondering testily why local mothers could not at least drop in for \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca beer once a week when it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not crowded.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nof course, the practice of bringing babies and young children to bars is hardly exclusive to park slope. the issue has been debated in online message boards in cities like minneapolis, philadelphia and washington.\\na woman in boston, recently posting to yelp.com, a national, user-generated city-guide site, seemed appalled to see a 7-year-old next to her at a bar.

relentless gentrification.\\nthe founders of a local blog, takebacktheisland.wordpress.com, which purports to advocate the rights of the childless, were not alone among bloggers who interpreted union

after a neighborhood outcry. in 2005, a bartender at the patio lounge, a bar on fifth avenue, posted a sign \\xe2\\x80\\x94 still known as the infamous \\xe2\\x80\\x9cstroller manifesto\\xe2\\x80\\x9d

to the proprietors of union hall, it would seem like a valid question. mr. carden insisted the ban was pragmatic, not dogmatic. he explained that union hall contains any number of potential

costanza\\xe2\\x80\\x99s parents in \\xe2\\x80\\x9cseinfeld\\xe2\\x80\\x9d 20 years later. but the houses here are often embellished as mini-manors. because so many people live their whole lives in the neighborhood, their homes are sometimes passed between generations, avoiding the marketplace entirely.\\none property on 84th street, for example, is on the market for the first time since 1925; it still has its original stained-glass windows and cathedral ceilings from the era.\\nas for the commercial parts of the neighborhood, they have been gaining in sophistication. toyo, a japanese

last year, said salvatore crifasi, 53, president of crifasi real estate, a local resident who met his wife, catherine, by juniper valley park when he was 17 and she was 15.\\nmost single-family properties sell for $500,000 to $700,000, with some new condominiums near the m line subway terminal going for $300,000 to $400,000.\\nmultifamilies often have  scant parking (because they have gone up where single-family homes used to be). they run from around $400,000, for older properties, to the million-dollar mark for new construction.\\nmr. crifasi, who has been selling real estate in middle village since 1974, said about two-thirds of the buyers and sellers were \\xe2\\x80\\x9clocals playing musical chairs in their hometown, none of these yipsters who have been moving into places like astoria or williamsburg.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nthere are 97 one-, two- and three-family homes on the market, 44 of which are single-family; an additional 24 condos are for sale as well, mr. crifasi said.\\ntwo-family homes, like the whelans\\xe2\\x80\\x99, are a hot commodity  \\xe2\\x80\\x94  especially because renting out half of a home helps finances in these troubled times. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfour out of five calls i get are asking for two-family homes,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said alex benisatto, a local associate with coldwell banker.\\nlast year, 199 homes spent time on the market and 141 sold,  mr. crifasi said. the average sale price was $592,575; average time on the market was 84 days. that compares with 106 homes on the market so far this year, with 37 closing after an average of 93 days, for an average price of $582,196.\\nthe commute\\nin july, the q54 was rerouted to add a stop at the shops at atlas park (which opened in 2006 and is named after the bodybuilder charles atlas, who was a middle villager). that line also makes a stop at the m station, which terminates at metropolitan avenue. this means no sardine-can experiences as you board the train into manhattan. it takes about 30 minutes to get to midtown. the m, which now ends downtown, is to be extended through brooklyn, to the dekalb and atlantic avenue stations and almost to coney island.\\nwhat to do\\nthe middle village chamber of commerce\\xe2\\x80\\x99s third annual community day was sept. 7. about 5,000 residents attended the festivities in juniper valley park, for free amusement rides, popcorn, soda and other  treats.\\nparents often let their children play in the fountains at atlas park. in the winter months, those same children may very well be taken to the hockey rink now available at juniper valley park.\\nlucy accardo, who is involved in a group she called mom\\xe2\\x80\\x99s club, says mothers are tightly knit and regularly meet up at the local new york sports club or borders bookstore (where employees hold readings for children).\\nmrs. accardo and her husband, claudio, have four children, ages 3, 6, 7 and 9. she also runs a parenting health and wellness business via the web, mykidsaremyboss.com. she says she likes middle village\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tranquil pace. \\xe2\\x80\\x9ci grew up in astoria, lived there forever and still never really got to know my neighbors, because they were always moving in or out,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand it was always changing and growing, trying to be a mini-manhattan. middle village is the opposite of that. i take the stroller to pick up my kids after school and i\\xe2\\x80\\x99m actually pushing the stroller down the street, not jamming it into the car.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nthe

students go to grover cleveland, forest hills or newtown. according to andrew jacob of the city education department, forest hills had the best sat averages last year: 458 in reading, 486 in math and 454 in writing, versus 488, 504 and 481 statewide. grover cleveland\\xe2\\x80\\x99s averages were 399, 434 and 398; newtown\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 387, 439 and 384.\\namong parochial schools are our lady of

mainstay since the 19th century, when the catholic and lutheran churches bought farmland. in 1915, juniper swamp was filled in to become juniper valley park. the area has also had mafia connections: anthony aiello and vincent ganci both lived here; john gotti and lucky luciano are buried at st. john\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cemetery.\\n', '', '', 'modeled on the protests and celebrations that erupt on the national mall, jean shin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s latest installation \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a roiling, shoulder-to-shoulder crowd in miniature \\xe2\\x80\\x94 will carpet a 45-foot-long rectangular space at the smithsonian american art museum in washington beginning may 1. the figures will be gleaming trophies, stripped of their sports paraphernalia and refashioned with new props into janitors, cashiers, mailmen and other unsung laborers, now pushing their strollers or swinging their hammers in exalted form.\\nms. shin, who was commissioned by the museum to create the installation, \\xe2\\x80\\x9ceveryday monuments,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as part of her exhibition \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccommon threads,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was inspired by washington as a city planned around its heroic monuments. \\xe2\\x80\\x9ci thought of these trophies as a way to bring the monumentality to a more intimate level,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said ms. shin, 37, an artist known for her vast accumulations of singular castoff objects \\xe2\\x80\\x94 old clothing, empty prescription bottles, losing lottery tickets \\xe2\\x80\\x94 which she transforms into arresting installations that loosely reflect the people who once used the items.\\nfor \\xe2\\x80\\x9ceveryday monuments,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d which will be on view through july 26, she gathered donations of more than 2,000 trophies with the help of the smithsonian and local donors who included parents of students at walt whitman high school in bethesda, md., which she attended after her family moved from south korea when she was 6. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe trophies can have a second life and be updated to represent all the people who maybe never won trophies or decided not to be sports stars but live their lives through work,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said.\\nwhen ms. shin first conceived of the piece a couple of years ago, she was thinking of grand moments on the national mall like the rev. dr. martin luther king jr.\\xe2\\x80\\x99s historic speech there and the million man march, but she could never have foreseen the flooding of people into the space for president obama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s inauguration. joanna marsh, curator of the exhibition, considers it serendipity.  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cit was wonderful to see that actualized just as the piece was coming together, and it will be so fresh in people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s minds when they see the work,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said, adding that the exhibition will also include seven other large-scale installations ms. shin has created since 2000.\\non a recent morning at her small studio in brooklyn, filled with a team of assistants meticulously attaching tiny cast mops, paint rollers, cash registers and computers to hundreds of trophies, ms. shin described watching her parents, who had both been professors in seoul, struggle with discrimination and menial jobs when they moved to the washington area, where they eventually owned a supermarket and liquor store. for a child the adjustment was easier. in high school she was encouraged to pursue painting seriously, and in her senior year in 1990 she entered the national presidential scholars in the arts competition and won a full scholarship to the pratt institute in brooklyn, her own trophy of sorts.\\nafter receiving her b.f.a. in painting in 1994, she went on at pratt to get a master\\xe2\\x80\\x99s degree in art history and criticism and then took a day job at the whitney museum as a curatorial assistant. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmy studio practice really shifted by studying art history and criticism,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said ms. shin, who began questioning her reasons for making figurative painting and struggled to find a new direction and choice of materials.\\none day it occurred to the petite ms. shin as she was organizing her cluttered williamsburg apartment that all the cuffs of fabric that she had trimmed from the bottom of her pants were the same size. \\xe2\\x80\\x9ci didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t fit fashion\\xe2\\x80\\x99s standard by exactly two-and-a-half inches,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfashion is so much about these ideals. i began to think about how using the leftover pant legs could be personal and physical as well as speak to our collective desires.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nshe canvassed alterations shops and found people who agreed to save their pant-leg scraps for her. gathering hundreds of these cylindrical forms, ms. shin dipped them in wax to make them stiff. then, for a group show at gen art in new york in 1998, she installed a roughly 12-by-12-foot cityscape of cuffs across the floor, suggesting a population that didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t measure up. called \\xe2\\x80\\x9calterations\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and purchased by the collector peter norton, the piece also alluded to the largely asian immigrant work force that does most of the tailoring jobs in new york.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cnow that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s become a really important part of my work,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said of the community collaboration required for \\xe2\\x80\\x9calterations,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgoing up to total strangers and somehow implicating myself in the objects of their lives. any material i get is the beginning of a conversation and a relationship.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nms. shin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s earlier work was defined by her use of clothing as surrogates for people. but since 2004, when she had her first solo show, at the frederieke taylor gallery in new york, ms. shin has branched out more to nonfabric materials that still have a physical relationship to the body. for \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctextile,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d made in 2006 in collaboration with the fabric workshop and museum in philadelphia, she took apart old computer keyboards to illuminate how these objects, touched by rote with our fingertips, project our thoughts out into the world. more than 22,000 key caps, spelling out all the e-mail messages between the artist and the fabric workshop about the making of the artwork, were embedded into a 20-foot-long fabric scroll.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cchemical balance,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d also part of the smithsonian show, alludes to how we change the chemistry of our bodies through prescription drugs. ms. shin gathered empty orange pill bottles and assembled them into towering arrangements that appear to grow out of the floor or dangle from the ceiling. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cany organic structure that we see in nature bonds together and then falls apart for its own purposes of growth and decay,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said ms. shin, who is interested in mirroring society\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dependence on these drugs.\\nshe has very particular criteria for the salvaged materials she uses in her work: that something is \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccast off from a person\\xe2\\x80\\x99s life because its desirability and usefulness are questioned, that it in some way archives a personal history but also can speak to larger issues going on in our culture.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cand then,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she added, \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccan i deconstruct it and make it new?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nher recently completed mosaic, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cceladon remnants,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d commissioned by the metropolitan transportation authority\\xe2\\x80\\x99s arts for transit program and installed along the outdoor stairwell of a long island rail road station in a densely populated korean-american community in queens, was inspired by the elegance and fragility of celadon pottery commonly found in korean homes. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a celebrated moment in history when koreans perfected this ceramic that people take lots of pride in,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said.\\nfor the project ms. shin traveled to icheon, just outside seoul, and persuaded the government to donate a vast landscape of broken pottery from outside one of the major kilns.\\nshe then used her budget for materials to ship the three tons of shards back to the united states, where she worked with a fabricator to reconstitute the fragments into large, partial silhouettes showing just enough of the curves to suggest vases but also evoking the abstract shapes of ellsworth kelly. literally and metaphorically she reunited something broken in korea in a new form in america.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cfor me,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe greater only happens by the accumulation of many, one piece at a time.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n', 'modiin illit, west bank \\xe2\\x80\\x94 seen from afar, this fast-growing settlement embodies everything that the obama administration wants to address through its demand for a freeze on settlement building: it sits on land captured by israel in the 1967 middle east war and, with 45,000 residents and 60 births a week, it is the largest and fastest-growing jewish community in the west bank.\\nif, as is widely believed abroad, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnatural growth\\xe2\\x80\\x9d by israeli settlers is blocking the creation of a viable palestinian state, this community should show why.\\nbut appearances are deceiving. modiin illit and its sister community, beitar illit, are entirely ultra-orthodox, a world apart, one of strict religious observance and study. they offer surprising potential for compromise.\\nunlike settlers who believe they are continuing the historic zionist mission of reclaiming the jewish homeland, most ultra-orthodox do not consider themselves settlers or zionists and express no commitment to being in the west bank, so their growth in these settlement towns, situated just inside the pre-1967 boundary, could be redirected westward to within israel.\\ntheir location also means it may be possible, in negotiations about a future palestinian state, to redraw the boundary so the settlements are inside israel, with little land lost to the palestinians. and the two towns alone account for half of all settler growth, so if removed from the equation, the larger settler challenge takes on more manageable proportions.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cif i thought this was a settlement, i would never have come here,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said yaakov guterman, 40, the mayor of modiin illit and a grandfather of three, his orthodox fringes hanging from his belt, his side locks curled behind his ears. asked about the prospect of a palestinian state rising one day on his town line, he said: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwe will go along with what the world wants. we have gone through the holocaust and know what it means to have the world against us. the torah says a man needs to know his place.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nwhether or not mr. guterman will be as pliant as he says, middle east peace negotiators on all sides \\xe2\\x80\\x94 israeli, palestinian and american \\xe2\\x80\\x94 have long viewed small border adjustments and land swaps as key to a deal that would include a solution to the hundreds of thousands of jews who have settled in the west bank over the past four decades.\\nthis week, three senior american officials will be in jerusalem for talks that will include settlements:  the middle east envoy, george j. mitchell; the white house middle east adviser, dennis ross; and the national security adviser, gen. james jones. secretary of defense robert  m. gates will also be in talks in jerusalem.\\nbreak with settler movement  \\nthe ultra-orthodox inhabitants often express contempt for the settler movement, with its vows never to move. the people here, who shun most aspects of modernity, came for three reasons: they needed affordable housing no longer available in and around jerusalem or tel aviv; they were rejected by other israeli cities as too cult-like; and officials wanted their presence to broaden israel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s narrow border.\\nyet they are lumped with everyone else. the settler movement  and the israeli government point to ultra-orthodox settlements, with their large and ever-increasing families, to argue that there is no way to stop \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnatural growth\\xe2\\x80\\x9d without imposing acute human suffering. those seeking a freeze use the settlements as evidence that growth is so out of control that drastic action must be taken. more broadly, opponents say the settlements violate international law, legitimize force by armed messianic jews and ruin the chance of establishing a viable palestinian state.\\nbut even those who strongly favor a complete freeze acknowledge that the annual settler growth rates of 5 and 6 percent owe a great deal to these two towns that have little to do with the broader settler enterprise.\\ndror etkes of yesh din, an antisettlement group in israel, noted that half of all construction in west bank settlements was taking place in these two ultra-orthodox communities, adding that given their location next to the boundary, it was highly likely they would be in israel in a future deal through a redrawn border. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfrom a purely geographic point of view, construction there is not as destructive as elsewhere,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said.\\nbut he  does not want building to continue in modiin illit or beitar illit without a deal for a palestinian state, nor does he mean to imply that these settlements have been a benign force. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cland has been taken from palestinians, in some cases from private landowners, for the building in these settlements, and there are many other issues like sewage flow into palestinian villages that must be addressed,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d mr. etkes said.\\nsettler leaders reject any distinction. the fact that the ultra-orthodox came to the west bank to solve their housing problems is \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccompletely o.k. with me,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said dani dayan, chairman of the yesha council, the settlers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 political umbrella group. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthey are an integral part of our endeavor and our achievement.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n the palestinian view \\nbut even in bilin, the palestinian village that abuts modiin illit and has become a symbol of palestinian resistance against israel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s west bank separation barrier, the settlers over the fence are viewed as different from the jewish nationalists in, say, hebron.\\nabedallah abu rahma, a teacher from a farming family and a leading activist in the village, pointed toward the settler high-rise buildings visible across the valley from his living room window and said: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthey tell us, \\xe2\\x80\\x98we are poor, the apartments here are cheaper and we did not know it was a settlement.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 many told us, \\xe2\\x80\\x98give us our money back and we will leave.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xc2\\xa0\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nthe palestinians, who hold weekly demonstrations against the barrier, have even joined forces with some of the settlers. two years ago, bilin won a major supreme court case  that forced a change in the route of the barrier, and some of the documents the victorious villagers used, mr. abu rahma said, had been secretly passed to them by ultra-orthodox settlers feuding with their own municipal leaders.\\nstill, none of that lessens the harm to the villagers caused by the very existence of modiin illit and the contest over its land. mr. abu rahma said he would respect any agreement reached between the palestinian leadership and israel, including one that had  modiin illit standing in israel. but noting the village\\xe2\\x80\\x99s reliance on agriculture, its own housing needs and the settlement\\xe2\\x80\\x99s encroachment on bilin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s territory, he insisted, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwe need our land.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nmoreover, protecting the settlements from attack has meant construction of numerous barriers, checkpoints and bypass roads that impair economic development and disrupt daily life.\\nacross the west bank and excluding east jerusalem, there are nearly 300,000 settlers living on scores of settlements among 2.3 million palestinians. and while some say they will fight to stay put, a third are the reluctant ultra-orthodox, known in israel as haredim, hebrew for the fearful ones, or those who tremble in awe of god.\\nthey believe it important to live in the land of israel, because certain commandments can be performed only here. but some haredim actively reject the formation of a jewish state before the arrival of the messiah, while others are ambivalent. they also say that protecting life trumps holding territory. very few serve in the military because the ultra-orthodox say they do more good for the nation by studying the torah and praying than fighting.\\nuntil his death in 2001, rabbi eliezer schach  was the religious authority of the  haredim of european origin. he opposed building jewish settlements that extended over the 1967 line into territory israel seized in the war, once calling them \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca blatant attempt to provoke the international community\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and complaining that they endangered jewish lives. in fact, when first offered housing for his followers in beitar illit, he took it as an insult, according to yitzchak pindrus, a former mayor of the settlement.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cour people live around their families and rabbis, and they were terrified of the idea,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d mr. pindrus recalled. but with thousands of new couples marrying every year, and the traditional ultra-orthodox communities expensive and crowded, the haredim needed homes.\\nbecause few ultra-orthodox men work, because on average their families have eight children and because they do not integrate easily into the larger community, teddy kollek, who was  mayor of jerusalem in the late 1980s, wanted to keep down their numbers. other cities rejected them. yitzhak rabin,  as both defense minister and then prime minister,  championed the creation of large settlements around jerusalem to fortify israel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hold on the capital, in line with his labor party\\xe2\\x80\\x99s strategic plan, so he and the haredim struck a deal for beitar illit in the early 1990s.\\nfor those wanting to remain closer to longstanding haredi communities in the center of the country, modiin illit was an alternative. private israeli developers bought tracts of palestinian land  as its base, although the legitimacy of those sales has been challenged. mr. guterman, the mayor,  said mr. rabin \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgave his blessing to the city,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d telling rabbi schach\\xe2\\x80\\x99s disciples that its strategic location on the first rise above israel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s international airport guaranteed that it would not be given back.\\nthere are smaller pockets of haredi settlement deeper in the west bank, where the arm\\xe2\\x80\\x99s-length attitude toward zionist settlement has shifted toward a more distinctly right-wing ideology. zvi kastelanitz, of the immanuel settlement, who produces silver-inlaid jewish handicrafts, for example, said he had no objection to two states for two peoples, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut not here.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d still, the haredi settlers even there remain distinct. after palestinians ambushed two buses on the road to immanuel, southwest of nablus, in 2001 and 2002, killing a total of 20 people, the haredi settlers did not react like their nationalist counterparts, defiantly setting up another settlement outpost. instead, about a third of immanuel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 4,000 residents left.\\nshunning secular world \\nthe haredi world is all about being together and apart from secular temptations, an intricate patchwork of groups with allegiances to different rabbinic dynasties and courts. in the new cities, haredi rules apply. at the entrance to beitar illit, a sign warns visitors to dress modestly. the streets are all named for rabbis and sages from poland to yemen. there is internet access, officially intended for professional use only. televisions are allowed, but nobody admits to having one. and there is poverty: about 40 percent of wives support their large families because their husbands do not work. there are few cars, lots of buses and baby strollers.\\ndov fromowitz, a father of nine who moved  to beitar illit from the williamsburg section of brooklyn 12 years ago, runs a central charity fund that collects money from better-off residents and distributes it to the poor, while connecting them with other social welfare services outside the settlement. he says he has 1,200 needy families on his books.\\nwithout most israelis noticing, modiin illit and beitar illit have turned into the haredi towns of the future, cleaner and saner versions of their often decrepit and densely packed neighborhoods elsewhere. they contain open space, even some greenery, and apartments with lots of bedrooms. their young are shielded from secular israel, and secular israelis never see them, thereby reducing the tensions found in jerusalem over driving on the sabbath and sexy advertising at bus stops.\\nthe question of coexistence \\neven if the ultra-orthodox appear to be less ideologically committed to the west bank, the longer they live here, the more invested some have become.\\nin modiin illit, mayor guterman has ambitions to build what he calls \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe largest haredi residential community in israel.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d over the past three years, he has set up a business center that he considers the wave of the future. now 1,000 women, mostly mothers in their 20s, sit at work stations providing phone services to israeli credit card clients and paralegal research for real estate businesses in the united states. it is outsourcing that seeks to take advantage of the educational level and work ethic of haredi women.\\nthe question of coexistence with palestinians hovers, however. in beitar illit, farmers from the village of husan enter daily in cars and on donkeys to work their lands in the valleys among the settlements\\xe2\\x80\\x99 built-up hills. the new mayor, meir rubinstein, is proud of the city\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cooperation with local palestinians, whom he calls \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe neighbors.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cwe very much want there to be peace here,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwe pray for it three times a day.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d but the question of peace at what price remains.\\navraham and riva guttman, who arrived in beitar illit 15 years ago from toronto and have seven children, look out from their street at palestinian villages. they believe strongly in living in the land of israel, they say, and they are happy for the parks and space lacking in traditional haredi areas of israel. but they do not insist that it is there or nothing. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwe are not here for political reasons,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d mr. guttman said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cninety percent of the people are here for the affordability, not for ideology. haredim don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t fight with arabs.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nperhaps not, but his wife, riva, bristled at the idea of moving. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cif you told me to move elsewhere because arabs needed a place to live, it would not sit quietly on my conscience,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9ci am a jew in the jewish homeland.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nand increasingly, the haredim have vested interests over the 1967 line. yaron and sara simchovitch arrived in beitar illit from jerusalem 13 years ago with a group led by their rabbi. the couple now have a thriving butcher shop.\\nyoseph shilhav, an expert on the ultra-orthodox at bar-ilan university, said that almost every haredi family now had a member beyond the 1967 border, subtly shifting their attitudes about  settlement and withdrawal. the haredim make up 10 percent of israel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s population and are a fast-growing electoral force. the chabad movement and sephardic or middle eastern-origin shas party have increasingly adopted the nationalist agenda.\\nthe rocket fire into israel that resulted after its withdrawal from gaza in 2005 has also taken its toll on haredi views. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cin general, haredim are very practical people,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said mr. pindrus, the former beitar illit mayor. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwe are not right or left. if we get up in the morning and see that leaving gaza means missiles, then no, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not leaving another centimeter.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he added, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwe want to live, and our children not to blow up.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nstill, a surprising number do not oppose the establishment of a palestinian state if safety can be guaranteed. since housing is the no. 1 haredi concern and they feel no need for it to be in the west bank, redirecting the building of their new homes inside israel could go a long way toward a solution.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cif the americans can convince us there will really be peace and we won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be living in fear of rockets, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll bring a recommendation to our rabbis,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said mr. guterman, the mayor of modiin illit. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cour rabbis want peace. we are not against withdrawing from territory. but life is above all.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n', 'new york used to be  a second-string city when it came to

cappuccino\\xe2\\x80\\x99s foam at third rail coffee in the west village aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t just to show off, but are a sign that the barista properly steamed the milk so that it holds its form.\\nat abra\\xc3\\xa7o in the east village, you can get drip coffee brewed by the cup, not drawn from an urn.\\nfor years new yorkers had to look to places like stumptown coffee roasters in portland, ore., or blue bottle coffee in san francisco for this kind of quality. now both companies have opened roasters and coffee bars in new york. four barrel coffee of san francisco will be roasting here soon.\\nmeanwhile, some established cafes around the city have made moves toward roasting their own beans. caf\\xc3\\xa9 grumpy is already doing it, and abra\\xc3\\xa7o will by the summer.\\nthis means that new yorkers can now drink coffee that is made from some of the best beans available in the united states, freshly roasted in town.\\nthe difference between a cup of coffee from these new style coffee bars and what was available before is striking.\\nthese shops use only beans that have been roasted in the past 10 days (though some say two weeks is fine), so the flavors are still lively.\\nthe beans are ground to order for each cup. certain coffee bars have a skyline of grinders: one for espresso, one for decaffeinated espresso, one for brewed coffee. if they offer more than one variety of espresso bean, that gets its own grinder, too.\\nmilk is steamed to order for each macchiato or latte. a telltale sign is an arsenal of smaller steam pitchers, instead of one big one.\\nand coffee bars reaching for the highest rung use only manual espresso machines run by baristas who, in the past three years, have been able to attend classes given by the leading roasting companies in the intricacies of these devices. many chain stores are turning to automatic machines with preset levels for coffee, temperature and timing.\\nfor brewed coffee, there are french press pots, filter cones or machines like the clover or bunn\\xe2\\x80\\x99s new trifecta.\\nsome of the obsessiveness may get a bit off-putting. want an espresso to go at ninth street espresso? forget it. the baristas there believe it should be drunk immediately from a warm ceramic cup. want a cappuccino made from single-origin beans at kaffe 1668? sorry, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be told, but milk would overpower the subtle flavors of the coffee. wonder why the barista pulled and tossed out two shots of espresso before she served you yours? she was making sure it was perfect, the coffee evenly tamped, the water temperature ideal for the particular beans, the timing just right. (the best baristas will \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdial in\\xe2\\x80\\x9d throughout the day, tasting the espresso and adjusting the grind and dose.)\\nwant a double espresso? you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll have to buy two singles.\\ntoday, most of the chains use about seven grams of ground coffee for a two-ounce shot. espresso pods are filled with around five grams.\\nbaristas at the best places in town, like bluebird coffee shop or joe, tamp down between 19 and 21 grams. often the espresso is even more concentrated because it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pulled \\xe2\\x80\\x9cshort,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d with less water, so that the final volume is a thick 1.5 to 2 ounces.\\nwith that much coffee \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and care \\xe2\\x80\\x94  put into each shot, baristas feel that a larger shot, with more water, would compromise the quality of the espresso.\\nthis awakening has led some unlikely businesses to offer serious, artful drinks. saturdays surf, a minimalist surf shop in soho, has a vintage la marzocco machine next to the cash register. at moomah, a children\\xe2\\x80\\x99s center in tribeca, parents can enjoy one of the city\\xe2\\x80\\x99s more artful cappuccinos.\\neven restaurants, where coffee has long been an afterthought, are getting in on the act.\\nsuperior coffee, day after day: increasingly it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the rule in new york, not the exception.\\nhere are places in new york serving the best

professionally and personally.\\non the job front, both found satisfying niches. mr. fortuna works for google as a senior software engineer. ms. fortuna, a civil engineer, is employed by a consulting firm that is helping to renovate the 107-year-old williamsburg bridge.\\nbut finding a place to live in a big and sometimes unforgiving city proved daunting. knowing little about new york and having few friends to whom they could turn for guidance, the fortunas ended up in a prewar building on the upper west side in a studio that had been reconfigured as a cramped one-bedroom apartment.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cit was also a fourth-floor walk-up,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d ms. fortuna recalled. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut the worst thing was that the building turned out to be infested with bedbugs. i\\xe2\\x80\\x99d see them crawling on the mailboxes when i walked in the front door.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nthe fridge was so old that when the light burned out, replacement bulbs were no longer available. trucks barreling down columbus avenue jolted the fortunas awake at 5 in the morning. occasionally they looked at other apartments, but with little success.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cwe didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know anyone in the city who could give us advice,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d ms. fortuna said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand that made it hard.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\none day the following summer, the couple took the tram to roosevelt island, just to admire the view. they barely set foot on the island; they turned right around and went back to manhattan. but the casual outing introduced them to a corner of the city that would ultimately offer an apartment and a community in which they would feel utterly at home. after their lease on the upper west side ran out, roosevelt island was their next stop.\\nthe couple\\xe2\\x80\\x99s first toehold there was an apartment in a newish high-rise. it was also a 10-minute walk from the island\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lone subway stop. finding the bus service erratic, they traveled to and from the subway by bike, but  that proved less fun as winter approached and even worse when it rained. still, they savored the pace and friendliness of island life.\\nthey especially relished the walkway that runs along the island\\xe2\\x80\\x99s western rim, a popular route along which strollers and bench sitters could admire the manhattan skyline while perched beside the water.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cyou see the same people day after day,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d ms. fortuna said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthey say hi. you say hello. it felt really good. we didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know many people in new york. but thanks partly to this street, we got to know people here.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\ntwo years after they settled on the island and now both 29, they lucked out further when a two-bedroom condominium became available in riverwalk court, a brand-new high-rise just steps from the subway. the condo\\xe2\\x80\\x99s owner had been buffeted by the recession, and even before he moved in,  decided to sublet the apartment and live somewhere cheaper elsewhere on the island.\\nthe fortunas, who arrived last february and pay $3,100 a month, are the apartment\\xe2\\x80\\x99s first residents. everything was so new, they could  smell the varnish on the hardwood floors. the chalk-white walls were so pristine, the couple were at first reluctant to hang pictures.\\nalthough modest in size, the apartment radiates traces of the glamour associated with those pieds-\\xc3\\xa0-terre familiar from 1940s movies set in the more luxurious precincts of manhattan \\xe2\\x80\\x94 \\xe2\\x80\\x9call windows and filled with light,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as a friend described the place.\\nin the living room, floor-to-ceiling windows open onto views of the east river, the 59th street bridge, the manhattan skyline and the seemingly endless expanse of queens. barges drifting along the river offer an endlessly shifting vista. even the hulking power plant over in astoria appears  picturesque. looking down, the couple can see the grassy field where mr. fortuna plays soccer and softball on weekends.\\nthe views are nearly as dazzling in the bedroom, where the bridge seems so close, you feel as if you could reach out and touch one of its girders. especially for a woman whose workdays focus on the rehabilitation of one of the city\\xe2\\x80\\x99s famous bridges, these vistas seem singularly appropriate.\\nthe furnishings, among them the spare black dining table, the gray and white sofa in the living room and the multicolored pillows heaped on the sofa bed in the second bedroom, came largely by way of ikea. the store was also the source of an urban scene almost as compelling as the one out their windows  \\xe2\\x80\\x94  a copy of angelo cavalli\\xe2\\x80\\x99s famous black-and-white photograph of the flatiron building framed by a dense swath of the city.\\nthe fortunas themselves are avid photographers, and their walls are filled with images of the two of them, eyes shining and glossy dark hair gleaming, against one or another exotic backdrop. here is ms. fortuna on the beach in rio. here are the two of them kissing near the eiffel tower. here they are kissing again in the turks and caicos islands.\\nthe contents of their bookshelves seem an amalgam of their varied interests, home to her engineering texts (\\xe2\\x80\\x9catmospheric chemistry and physics\\xe2\\x80\\x9d), his computer books (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cweb data mining\\xe2\\x80\\x9d), a few titles in portuguese and textbooks that have over the years helped the couple perfect their english (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe ins and outs of prepositions\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).\\nunless you peered behind closed doors to see the two walk-in closets or the washer/dryer, you might miss what for ms. fortuna are among the apartment\\xe2\\x80\\x99s main attractions. but you would never miss the couple\\xe2\\x80\\x99s two beloved cats, strays born on the island and rescued by a group called island cats.\\nthe fortunas found daisy, now 3, who is gray with white feet, through an ad in the main street wire, the island newspaper, where \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthere was a big picture of her,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d ms. fortuna recalled. fletcher, now a lively brown 1-year-old, joined the household as a foster cat and proved so adorable the couple couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t bear to give him to another family.\\njust as the waterfront promenade helped the fortunas sink roots in this community, so did the rescue group. when the couple first arrived, ms. fortuna used to look out the window of their apartment and see the clusters of people who helped feed and otherwise care for the island\\xe2\\x80\\x99s strays. she and her husband signed up as volunteers and in doing so acquired an instant set of new and compatible friends.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9creally,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d mr. fortuna said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthese friends are one of the reasons we stay on the island.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nmore recently, the couple celebrated another landmark that has helped them feel deeply connected to the community.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9ctwo months ago they put our building on google earth,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d mr. fortuna, the computer whiz, said proudly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat made us feel wonderful.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n', 'when world record holder haile gebrselassie dropped out of the new york city marathon just more than halfway through, it

apparently was too intense before he even made it to manhattan.\\nnew york road runners officials said gebrselassie underwent an mri on saturday night and there was fluid found on his knee.\\nthis is

fun and highly focused sites like street mattress (founded in 2001 and still posting pictures of discarded posturepedics). at the other are more academically minded ruminations on refuse, like discard studies, started in august. last night\\xe2\\x80\\x99s garbage occupies a space between these two poles. photographs of trash dominate the blog and provide its author, jed tamarkin, with inspiration for writing short bits of fiction.\\nthe blog, which gets about 25,000 page views a month, has evolved since mr. tamarkin began shooting pictures outside his east village apartment in the summer of 2007. each photo was accompanied by text describing a fictional character with some relationship to whatever toy or commode or stroller happened to be lying on the street as mr. tamarkin passed by with his canon point-and-shoot. (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cthere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a lot of baby strollers for some reason,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said.) tags along the right side of the blog chronicle some of the recurring characters. there is ross, a hard-drinking artist with relationship troubles; stef, a chatty and celebrity-obsessed young woman; and bobby, a drug-addled musician. there are also people who appeared only once, tossed off like so many old items of clothing. \\nmore recently, mr. tamarkin began pairing photographs with reposted bits of content to create \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca nudge and a rib\\xe2\\x80\\x9d about the wastefulness of consumer culture. in a post from july, an excerpt from a \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccbs news\\xe2\\x80\\x9d article about a man who was fined for taking garbage off the street runs underneath a photograph of a destroyed air-conditioner. the juxtaposition is funny and seems to carry a subtle message: not all trash is someone else\\xe2\\x80\\x99s treasure; most of it just ends up in the landfill.\\nbehind the screen \\xe2\\x80\\x9ci was on the first floor, and there was garbage accumulating everywhere,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d mr. tamarkin, 31, an advertising art director, said of the apartment that provided early grist for the blog. his window faced a shaft at the rear of the building, where years of refuse had caked into the concrete. \\xe2\\x80\\x9ci had crazy rat problems,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said.

how did the government function? what was the economy like in this land of bottomless cups and table hoggers? and what, oh what, were they all writing?\\ni was, admittedly, a profoundly skeptical observer. though i had been a freelance writer for the last eight years, i had always worked at home, clad in pajamas and brewing my own fuel rather than paying $3 for someone to make pretty designs in my caffeinated foam. whenever my wife suggested that i get out of the house, maybe take my laptop to a cafe, i shot back: \\xe2\\x80\\x9creal freelancers don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t work in coffee shops. it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just unemployed hipsters and their unpublished novels, or screenplays, or facebook stati.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nmy disdain for the coffee shop writing scene only grew this june, when i met a friend at the red horse cafe in park slope. i had previously been there only on weekends, when it was filled with couples sharing the sunday paper and parents wiping brownie residue off their toddlers. that weekday afternoon it was a place transformed. gone were the newspapers and the strollers. laptops had colonized every flat surface. no one uttered a word; people just stared into screens, expressionless. it felt like that moment in a horror movie when the innocent couple stumbles into a house filled with hibernating zombies, and they listen, in terror, as the floorboard creaks.\\nmy friend and i ordered our coffee, and began to discuss whatever it was we were there to discuss. within seconds of opening my mouth, i felt a change in the room. eyes rose from their screens and landed on us \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the zombies were awake, and they weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t happy. one of them passed our table on the way to the washroom and let loose what can only be described as a snicker. we downed our coffee and beat a quick retreat. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cto hell with those laptop-wielding fundamentalists,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d i said.\\nso what was i doing in laptopistan? i moved from new york to toronto in september, but had come back to the city for a week and was sleeping on a friend\\xe2\\x80\\x99s couch. i needed a place to work. someone suggested atlas. i swallowed my skepticism and got my passport ready.\\nset on the corner of havemeyer and grand streets, and flooded with light from two walls of windows, atlas caf\\xc3\\xa9, which opened in 2003, looks like a combination of worn trattoria and late 1990s seattle coffeehouse. the name reflects its wall-sized map of the world (there are also a mobile of hanging globes, and flourishes of d\\xc3\\xa9cor inspired by someone\\xe2\\x80\\x99s travel to the far east). the soundtrack is a mix of old country and folk (dylan, willy, cohen and cash), classical, bebop and french ballads.\\na makeshift milk station sits in the center of the 750-square-foot room. to the left is a long bar of dark stained rustic wood, where people order food and drink (proper espressos for $1.50, excellent panini, salads and deadly little chocolate-filled italian doughnuts,  $3), as well as the windowless, orange washroom. there are three stools at the bar, and beside them a table of reclaimed timber pressed against a cozy window bench. according to two signs, this little corner, perhaps one-sixth of the cafe, is designated a laptop-free zone.\\neverything beyond is laptopistan: two rows of old church pews formed into an elongated l, each fronted by small wooden tables and chairs. scattered along the pews are tattered blue tubular pillows, for lumbar support. windows run along the walls, flooding the computer zone with natural light during the day, creating a fishbowl effect for those inside looking out, and for passers-by, who frequently stop and stare at the tableau.\\nentering laptopistan is a task in itself. the floor presents an obstacle course of power cables snaking their way around coffee cups, over chairs, and around table legs, eventually finding a home in one of two power strips that look as though they came from a soviet coal refinery. whenever a plug is inserted, the outlet sparks, and certain movements can cause all the plugs on a given strip to simultaneously eject.\\na quick glance around shows i have brought my laptop, a month-old macbook pro, to its nesting ground. diversity here means the odd white macbook or old black powerbook scattered amid the silver macbook pros. throughout the week i will see only a handful of pcs, each looking sadly out of place, like they have arrived at a black-tie affair in a corduroy blazer.\\ni worked for a few hours, and quickly learned the principal laws of laptopistan:\\nsilence is golden. there is no prohibition on talking, of course, but, as one atlas regular of several years, joelle hann, explained, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s almost a code that people aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t going to talk loud.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d when people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s phones ring, they run outside as fast as possible to take the call.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cif someone\\xe2\\x80\\x99s on skype or having a conversation, people make an effort to chill out their conversations with looks,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said ms. hann, a yoga teacher and a freelance journalist and textbook editor. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhen they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t stop, you can feel the tension.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d shushing conversations is equally verboten. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cno one wants to be the librarian,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d ms. hann added.\\nrespect personal space. while any open seat is technically available, it is forbidden to set up your computer on a table with a computer already on it; doubling up is allowed only when all tables are taken. at the same time, people bounce from table to table throughout the day, chasing the sun, the shade or their own feng shui.\\nmind your neighborhood. when you get up to take a call, get coffee or use the washroom, you need only to look at a neighbor, make eye contact, look back at your computer and nod. the deal is sealed without a word: you watch my macbook and i\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll watch yours.\\nmost laptopistanis \\xe2\\x80\\x94 laptopistanites? laptopistanians? \\xe2\\x80\\x94 at atlas are in their 20s, 30s or early 40s, split evenly between men and women. the dress is casual, with both sexes wearing t-shirts, sweaters and jeans, though a few women seem dressed for \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwork\\xe2\\x80\\x9d with button-down blouses, blazers, even a dress or two. most laptopistanis work alone, though occasionally i spotted a group collaborating at a corner table. socially, laptopistan is a conservative society; outward displays of emotion are frowned upon. most people hide behind their screens.\\naaron tugendhaft is the exception. he appears at atlas every morning for a few hours, tie askew, black coffee at his side, some heady-looking book in front of him. mr. tugendhaft, who is an adjunct professor of religion at new york university and the editor of a small custom press, is one of the only atlas regulars i observed sans laptop.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9ci\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve made friends with people because i\\xe2\\x80\\x99m the only guy without a computer,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he told me, quietly, one morning. \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca book can be a conversation starter.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nmr. tugendhaft has been coming to atlas nearly every day for three and a half years, but there are many laptopistanis he has never spoken to. (\\xe2\\x80\\x9csome of them are in the room right now,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he confided in a low voice, eyeing a woman in a jean jacket two tables over.) he has dated fellow laptopistanis, but not anymore, preferring to keep romance out of the workplace. people tend to keep to themselves, he said, until something breaks the routine: an argument between lovers, news of a subway breakdown, or, most often, some sort of interaction around the power strips.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cpower is power,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d mr. tugendhaft said.\\nmallory roberts, a longhaired freelance astrophysicist, said that he had met two girlfriends (now exes), and his current roommate, via power-strip negotiations. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthree months ago courtney was looking for a plug and we got to talking,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said of the

at least for my personal intake of tea, bagels, sandwiches and salad, averaged $12 a day. other cafes popular with freelancers charge for wireless internet access and even table time, but the owners of the atlas, enrico lorenzetti and luca tesconi, refuse to. observing the gross daily consumption in laptopistan, where people seem to nurse a cup of coffee and a cookie  for hours, i could not imagine how the two managed to stay in business. but they said the laptops were a stealth economic engine.\\nwhile the people behind the screens spent a paltry $6 to $10 per day, their true value is as a draw for more profitable takeout customers, mr. lorenzetti said. from the moment the door opens at 7 a.m. until it closes at 9 p.m., the place is buzzing, a productive society, visible from the street through wraparound windows. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpeople come in to buy food and coffee to go, because they see a full crowd,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthey think \\xe2\\x80\\x98hey, this

was also gauri nanda, a product designer from detroit who created clocky, the alarm clock on wheels that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s featured at the moma store and sold worldwide. there was billy schultz, a

change in light is enough of an excuse to get up, walk around, clip my nails or head into the kitchen. though home offices seem like the perfect work environment, their unrestricted silence, uninterrupted solitude and creature comforts breed distraction. in laptopistan, i focused with intense precision, sitting motionless for hours at a time. at home, when the internet goes down, i feel professionally castrated, and usually retire to the sofa until the connection is restored. when the wireless network at atlas seized up two afternoons in a row, i just switched to off-line tasks without breaking stride. no one else seemed fazed, either. if anything, the place got more crowded. laptopistan provides structure, and freelancers, like children, secretly crave structure. you come to work, for two or four or eight hours, and you take comfort in the knowledge that everyone else is there to work as well. there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a silent social pressure to it all.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cit almost sounds sick,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said selena ross, a fellow canadian freelance journalist i sat next to one day, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut the fact that people are watching me do

on youtube.\\nso i unplugged my laptop, traded my sweat pants for jeans and walked two blocks to the nearest coffee shop. there was some country music playing at a comfortable volume, and the familiar sight of cords along the floor. i took a seat between a guy working on an identical macbook pro and a woman drawing in a journal, and i worked like i was back in atlas: productively, contentedly, fueled by a steady diet of earl grey tea, an economically acceptable quantity of cookies, and that social pressure i was craving.\\nafter an hour or so, the guy next to me got up to go to the washroom, turned toward his laptop and looked at me.\\nwith a nod, i completed the transaction. when he walked away, i smiled. it was not a big smile; most likely it was barely visible to anyone

for more than a mile on Manhattan's Lower East Side has been closed indefinitely for structural repairs, depriving Fourth of July celebrants of a waterfront site for watching fireworks this week, as well as joggers, bikers and strollers who use it daily.\\nThe commissioner of parks and recreation, Henry J. Stern, said yesterday that the East River Park promenade, which skirts the river from East 14th to Montgomery Streets, was shut down last week after an inspection found severe deterioration in most of the wooden pilings that support the esplanade.\\n''Two divers were making a study of the Manhattan foot of the Williamsburg Bridge and the seawall that runs down from 14th Street,'' Mr. Stern said. ''It is not a dry seawall. The promenade and some of the park is built on pilings. Basically, the divers reported that up to 80 percent of the pilings under the promenade were deteriorated.''\\nThe commissioner said repairs to the pilings might take two or three years, and that the 30-foot-wide promenade used by hundreds of joggers and strollers regularly would remain closed for the duration. But the closing will not affect use of East River Park, a 57-acre swath of softball and baseball fields, tennis, basketball and handball courts, picnic areas and other amenities.\\nThere was no immediate estimate of the cost of the repairs. Mr. Stern said city engineers had long recognized that the promenade seawall was deteriorating and would have to be replaced at an estimated cost of $10 million. He said that $865,000 had already been budgeted to plan for the new seawall.\\nEast River Park and its promenade date from the 1930's, when they were built in the era of Robert Moses, a city official known as a prolific builder of highways, parks and other public projects. The park, the largest in Lower Manhattan, is the front yard of a series of city housing projects -- Jacob Riis, Lillian Wald and Baruch -- and is used by thousands of Lower East Side residents.\\nMr. Stern said a temporary fence would be erected between the promenade and the park at a cost of $60,000. Yesterday, only yellow police tape cordoned off the promenade. The police plan to put sawhorses and assign officers along the edge of the park Wednesday night, when thousands of spectators are expected to gather there to watch the Macy's Fourth of July fireworks display.\\nThe fireworks will be set off from four barges in the East River between East 23rd and East 42nd Streets. The best viewing will be along Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive from 14th to 42nd Streets, as well as from areas of Brooklyn and Queens with an open view.\\nAlthough the promenade had not previously been closed, Mr. Stern said there had been problems with weakened portions of its railing over the river and that restrictions last year had been imposed to keep fireworks spectators from the edge.\\n\", \"South Williamsburg and Wall Street have two of the highest concentrations of renters under 25 in New York City, according to the 2000 census. But youth is about all they have in common.\\nThe city's 1995 revitalization plan for lower Manhattan precipitated a wave of residential conversions in the financial district. From 1995 to 2000, 1,577 residential units were created between Fulton and Liberty Streets east of Broadway, according to the Alliance for Downtown New York, a business group. Last year, 22 percent of those units were rented by people under 25.\\nJonathan Falcone, 23, moved to the area last year, after graduating from the University of Pennsylvania. Next month, he and three friends will move into a $6,000-a-month three-bedroom penthouse on John Street.\\nBrian G. Edwards, leasing director at the Halstead Property Company, said people in their 20's had led the migration into the neighborhood because most of the units are studios and one-bedrooms, landlords accept shares, and the area lacks amenities that attract families.\\nBy contrast, Hasidic Williamsburg is a bright, noisy tangle of children, strollers and trees. Rabbi David Niederman, executive director of the United Jewish Organizations, said most of the century-old brownstones in the neighborhood's heart had been carved into small apartments that rent for $700 to $1,000 a month.\\nIn the past decade new construction has allowed established families, which often include five or more children, to move out of the central brownstone blocks into large condominiums to the west and southeast. A new generation of newlyweds is taking their place.\\n''We have 400 to 500 weddings a year in Williamsburg of people between the ages of 19 and 22,'' Rabbi Niederman said. ''Because we don't believe in family planning, immediately after the wedding you're counting the days for your first baby.''   ERIKA KINETZ\\n\", \"Fred Wilpon became a New York real-estate plutocrat, the builder of tall towers along gilded blocks of Manhattan avenues, by excelling at the art of the calculated risk. The grandson of an immigrant Brooklyn street peddler, Wilpon left Bensonhurst on a full scholarship to the University of Michigan, and by age 30, he was back in New York, betting everything he had on reviving faded uptown properties -- and making lavish returns. Later, Wilpon was in the East Village before the boutiques, and he saw potential in Bedford-Stuyvesant when others saw only vacant lots and broken glass. ''He has,'' says his son Jeffrey, ''a nose for this stuff.''\\nBut there are the rare times when he doesn't need it. In Wilpon's business, every so often a proposal comes along that is so lush in its promise of profit and so elegant in its appeal to the deal maker's particular aesthetic that it requires no shrewd discerning at all. Early in 1998, Wilpon received just such an offer from Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.\\nWilpon, now 64, is not simply a real-estate developer. Along with his partner, the publishing heir Nelson Doubleday, he owns the New York Mets, and it was for this reason that the mayor of New York had come calling. Some months before, the mayor had met with George Steinbrenner, the principal owner of the Yankees. Steinbrenner, Wilpon learned, had told the mayor that he hoped a baseball stadium could be built on Staten Island to house a Yankee minor-league team. This made sense. Minor-league baseball attendance was booming as never before -- good for the Boss -- and the northeastern coast of Staten Island was badly in need of an economic fillip -- good for the mayor. What the pair now wanted from the Mets amounted to what people in real estate, like Fred Wilpon, refer to as the ceding of territorial rights. Because the Yankees and the Mets share baseball jurisdiction in the city, the Yankees could not place even a minor-league competitor in the area without the Mets' blessing.\\nOn the face of things, such a blessing would have been highly unlikely. Just a year before, the Mets had hoped to place a minor-league team on Long Island, only to have their efforts blocked by the Yankees. There lingered, as the mayor puts it, ''a certain amount of resentment.'' But the Brooklyn-born Giuliani also knew something about Fred Wilpon that went beyond his existence as a wise man of property. That is, Wilpon had been a childhood habitu\\xc3\\xa9 of Ebbets Field, the ballpark the Dodgers left behind when they moved to Los Angeles in 1957. The mayor says he believed Wilpon was like almost everyone else from that generation of Brooklyn natives -- a nostalgic, still recovering from the loss of the Dodgers. With all that in mind, he threw Wilpon his very fat pitch: you give Steinbrenner Staten Island, he'll give you Brooklyn, and the city will build small ballparks for each of you, design them to your specifications and rent them to you on long-term leases for nominal considerations. By last fall, two pairs of steam shovels had broken ground.\\nIn Staten Island, word that a baseball park was rising in the old railroad yards, along the shoreline near the St. George ferry terminal, excited the locals. Across the Narrows, in the Borough of Churches, the same news was received like something on the order of the second coming. Wilpon immediately became a modern-day duke of Flatbush: he was the hometown boy who made good across the river and then brought the prodigal pastime back to the game's most impassioned fans. The new team was named the Cyclones, and before the season even began, 80 percent of the entire summer's worth of tickets were sold. Wilpon quickly added a thousand more seats to his ballpark, and soon those, too, were going like cheesecakes.\\nAnd yet there were others in Brooklyn, skeptics, to whom Wilpon merited no more than a plangent ''fuhgeddaboudit.'' In place of the Dodgers, Wilpon was serving up these Cyclones, who would slap their singles and ground-rule their doubles against outfits like the Lowell Spinners, the Batavia Muckdogs and the Mahoning Valley Scrappers. The Cyclones were to be a low-level Mets farm team, members of the short season (76 games) Class A New York-Penn League, meaning that Wilpon had presented a fabled city of strivers with just the imprimatur it always dreaded: he was the major leaguer who made Brooklyn into a minor-league town.\\n''They don't look minor league at all,'' Wilpon was saying. he was seated in a luxury box at KeySpan Park, the home of the Cyclones, inspecting his charges, who were displaying competence beyond their classification while drubbing the Vermont Expos. That same observation applied even more accurately to Wilpon's surroundings, for they are what have very quickly made the Brooklyn Cyclones a truly compelling proposition. Wilpon did not simply broker the dual feat of importing the sport of the provinces into New York City while returning professional baseball to Brooklyn. He situated his team in the midst of one of the world's most famous entertainment settings, the five-mile spit of sand jutting into the sea known as Coney Island. The ground on which the young Cyclones were blowing away the baby Expos once held Steeplechase Park, the first of the Coney Island grand-scale amusement compounds. For generations of Americans, Coney Island was synonymous with escape, thrills, adventure, seduction and pleasure, making this among the more inspired locales ever to be seeded with a professional baseball park. The builder built well. The ballpark's graceless corporate nomenclature aside, the ambience is such that everywhere Wilpon turned his head now, baseball was meeting with carnival to winsome effect.\\nJust below him, along the interior concourse that frames the top row of seats in the stadium, vendors hawked soft ice cream, lemonade, handmade Brooklyn Italian ices, cotton candy, Brooklyn beer and Nathan's genuine Coney Island frankfurters. Lining up for these regional delicacies was a crowd that looked decidedly more like New York than the swarm of louts and swells who -- along with unseemly ticket prices -- have made the trip to Yankee or Shea Stadiums a decidedly mixed proposition for members of the metropolitan area's nonexecutive classes. With Cyclones tickets ranging from $5 to $10, here everybody could pay, and a little bit of everybody had. There were young men in do-rags, young women sporting pink hair, Girl Scout troops and their leaders, high-school lads shaded by baseball caps and yarmulkes, college students in hand-held contact with their inamorati and moms, pops and offspring aplenty.\\nWilpon said that ''we don't want to trade on the Dodgers -- we want to fit into this community,'' and at perfunctory glance, the appearances supported the notion. It is true that to Wilpon's right the radio booth was emblazoned with the notice ''Catbird Seat'' in homage to that fabled vernacularist, the Dodgers broadcaster Red Barber. Down on the field, intertwined with the Cyclones ''C'' above the bill on their caps, the Cyclones did sport an iconic white Dodger ''B.'' And the surfeit of advertisements painted on the outfield fences in fact included a tempting proposition from a Brooklyn haberdashery to Cyclones batsmen: ''Hit This Sign . . . Win a Suit!'' -- a shameless little madeleine recalling the old pledge from Abe Stark clothiers on the Ebbets Field wall.\\nAnother swatch of the new barrier, however, promised to remunerate a line drive off itself with a free ride for the whole ballpark on the Wonder Wheel. And right there, in vibrant illumination just beyond the fence in left field, spun the famous Ferris. There was also Astroland, the glittering arcades of Surf Avenue, and brightest of all, that Zeus of roller coasters, the Cyclone itself. To straightaway center field, Wilpon -- and his patrons -- could see strollers along the boardwalk, bathers drying out on the sand, gulls plunging from violet-hued twilight skies and sailboats bobbing in the Atlantic. Around in right was the spiffily repainted 271-foot-tall Parachute Jump tower (sans parachutes, alas). While it is true that KeySpan Park's sound system is both relentless and loud -- a craven feature of so many current professional ballparks -- Wilpon had circled the floodlights in rings of bright neon and sheltered the grandstand under enormous blue-and-yellow-striped beach umbrellas. It was, in the end, a new Coney Island amusement ballpark, and Wilpon was feeling rather proud of it.\\n''Where'd all these people come from?'' he wondered. ''They weren't here last year.'' Then he was riffing on baseball (''It's the American way!''), explaining that the soaring minor-league profits around the country are a function of local ownership and confessing ''a father's pride'' that 39-year-old Jeffrey Wilpon is the man in charge of day-to-day operations for this already lucrative first-year franchise. Wilpon was wearing a checked shirt, butter-soft black loafers and a quantity of brilliantine that swept back the hair from his tanned, lean face. His wife of 41 years, Judy, was a few feet away. Wilpon may now live in a large home on Long Island, but he still serves Dr. Brown's cream soda to his guests, maintains close boyhood friendships -- one old Brooklyn pal is Sandy Koufax -- and enjoys talking about his immigrant Jewish grandmother, who pushed a fruits-and-vegetables cart along the streets of Williamsburg; his father, who presided over a small Brooklyn funeral parlor on Coney Island Avenue; and his sister Iris's husband, Saul Katz, his partner ever since way back when they had nothing.\\nYet although Wilpon is a sentimental person, he has the ears of a man who has heard a lot of requests and the ease of someone with experience in deflecting them. Wilpon is said to be seeking the better part of $500 million from the city to build the Mets a new ballpark in Queens. (His favored design resembles Ebbets Field -- with a retractable roof.) When the matter of these negotiations arose, Wilpon suddenly noted a nifty play by the Cyclones shortstop: ''They pick it! I like it!'' Mention of his relations with his Mets co-owner, Nelson Doubleday, which are said to be strident, produced only a garland for the Cyclones pitcher: ''Hey, this kid's got pretty good stuff!'' Then Guy Conti, a Mets roving minor-league instructor, stopped by to pay his respects, and Wilpon listened avidly as Conti gave impromptu talent evaluations, including testimony to the virtues of the Cyclones' most promising player, the fleet, vividly named center fielder from Puerto Rico, Angel Pagan. Two innings later, Pagan walked, stole second and third and then scored on a wild pitch, generating much jubilation below and more of the same in the owner's box.\\nThat is the usual situation at KeySpan Park these days. All 7,500 seats sell out, the first-place Cyclones win and even when they don't, the audience seems merely ecstatic. Sometimes the play is ragged: exuberant overthrows, haphazard infielding, 55-foot fastballs and undisciplined swinging. But nobody, not even New Yorkers, it seems, heads to minor-league games expecting to see Jackie Robinson, Mike Piazza or, for that matter, Del Bissonette. (You remember Del: ''The Dodgers have Del Bissonette/No meal has he ever missed yet/The question that rises/Is one that surprises/Who paid for all Del Bissonette?'')\\nPerhaps flawless baseball is precisely what the Cyclones fans don't wish for. They go to Brooklyn for many of the same reasons Americans all over the country now attend minor-league games in greater profusion than at any time since the 1940's, the glory days of bush-league ball. There are the KeySpan Park sight lines -- not a bad or distant view in the house. There is harmless between-innings fun, like the dizzy bat race. There is the opportunity to glimpse up close -- and maybe even chat with -- the Mets heroes of yore, Bobby Ojeda and Howard Johnson, who are Cyclones coaches. Best of all is the chance to see the players when their future is in doubt, when they are not wealthy, jaded and truculent but merely young athletes chasing an elusive ambition for $850 a month -- making them a lot like the people paying to see them.\\nOne recent evening, from their seats behind third base, Erika Warmbrunn, a Broadway stagehand, and Peter Guernsey, her stagehand boyfriend, were comparing the experience to ''time traveling.''\\n''It's baseball in the 40's,'' she said, ''when it really was America's game. A-Rod strikes out, and he's still guaranteed how many tens of thousands of dollars per at-bat? Here, a kid strikes out, and somebody who's watching says, 'That's it for him,' and the kid is gone. That's drama. That's real life. All that, and look where we're sitting for eight bucks.''\\nA few yards away, in the Cyclones dugout, was Bobby Ojeda, who went 18-5 pitching for the world-champion 1986 Mets. Eight years before that, he spent a New York-Penn League summer in Elmira, where he made $500 a month and was losing weight eating hot dogs every day and ''sleeping in hotels named after somebody's dog.''\\n''But I remember the realization 'I'm being paid for this!''' he said. ''It was a special, special time.'' Most former major leaguers of Ojeda and Howard Johnson's pedigree would rather be driving a golf cart than riding the Class A buses again, but Ojeda lives close by, in New Jersey, has higher aspirations in baseball and recognizes that he is the human analogue to this version of minor-league ball; literally Class A but more truly First-Class-A. The well-appointed big-city ballpark and the proximity to Shea Stadium make a man feel better about his chances of ''chasing a dream,'' as Ojeda calls the majors. ''These kids were here at the right place at the right time,'' he says. ''This is as good as it gets at this level.''\\nAngel Pagan would agree. Pagan spent last summer in Kingsport, Tenn., and began this one at an upper-level Mets Class A team in Columbia, S.C. He was hitting .300 and felt, therefore, somewhat aggrieved when Guy Conti told him the Mets wanted him to go down and play center field for Brooklyn. But the next time Conti encountered Pagan, even though the 20-year-old was sleeping on a cot in a temporarily converted classroom at a Catholic school in Bay Ridge, he now pleaded to stay where he was. ''I love it here, and I don't want to move,'' Pagan was saying now while signing autographs for an eager throng beside the dugout. ''Last year in Kingsport, there were 1,000 people a night. Here there are 7,500 a night. In Kingsport, you just see trees. Here, there's lots of things.'' Most of Pagan's roommates shuttle between their dormitory rooms and the ballpark, spending spare time doodling on the school chalkboards, but two weeks into the season, Pagan had ridden the Cyclone and explored a little of Coney Island. ''Last year, my mother sent me Latin food Express Mail,'' he says, ''but there are Latin restaurants on Mermaid Avenue. Tonight I had pork, rice and beans -- my favorite.''\\nWhat is revelation for Ojeda and Pagan is rediscovery for Eddy Rosenthal. Rosenthal is a Brooklyn warehouse distributor who went to Ebbets Field as a child, and he thinks the Cyclones are ''the best thing that ever happened to Brooklyn.''\\n''When we were young, the place was mobbed,'' Eddie says. ''It was a carnival on the side streets. There were booths and games and fortunetellers and fireworks. We'd walk on the boardwalk. Then the neighborhood changed, and it got dangerous. You didn't want to go on the boardwalk anymore.''\\nAt the turn of the century, Coney Island was the real crossroads of the world, and its millions of shimmering lights were the first sight of America for arriving European immigrants. In 1897, a Brooklyn entrepreneur named George Tilyou opened Steeplechase Park, the first Coney amusement city, and soon there was Luna Park and then Dreamland, places so fantastic in their design -- a luxurious hotel shaped like an elephant was just the start of it -- that Coney became the physical symbol of the American machine age. Everybody went. In the famed Weegee photograph taken in July 1940, there are a million people on the beach. Yet television, automobiles, shifting demographics and changing public tastes gradually obviated the big Brooklyn amusement parks. The neighborhood became dangerous, with bodies washing up on the beach and gunshots punctuating the evening air that once had been filled with calliope music.\\nNow, with his new stadium, Fred Wilpon was explaining that he hoped to use the minor-league baseball revival to inspire a Coney Island revival. ''I used to come here with my father,'' he said. ''We've tried to integrate the Coney Island we knew and what we know Coney Island will be. The reason for this location, aside from the fact that it's beautiful, was the need for a first-class attraction people could come to with the family at reasonable prices and have safe, attractive fun. It has all the infrastructure. It'll become a vital community again. When the redevelopment of 42nd Street was conceived, they said it couldn't be done. Look at 42nd Street now! I know this area, and I know the potential.''\\nA five-minute walk down Surf Avenue from the ballpark, at his continuously running freak show, Dick Zigun was willing to believe that Fred Wilpon just might be a sort of George Tilyou for the Disney era, an impresario who understood the pleasure-seeking tastes of his time in a way that would once again lure crowds to the Brooklyn shore. Zigun operates the annual Mermaid Parade and the nonprofit concern Coney Island USA, headquartered in his musty little sideshow gallery of sword swallowers and bed-of-nails acts. ''Financially, we haven't seen any change yet,'' he says. ''But in terms of people's impression of Coney Island, there is already a significant change.''\\nNot everybody has been persuaded. Kevin Baker, the author of ''Dreamland,'' a novel set at turn-of-the-century Coney Island, and the leader of historical tours of the area, says he believes that Fred Wilpon is the beneficiary of ''corporate welfare,'' a man making a profit that was handed to him by a lame-duck mayor concerned with ballpark legacies. ''Nobody consulted the public about whether we'd like to pay for these new ballparks,'' he says. ''They're great, but what do people who don't go to the games get? A tax bill. And New Yorkers who do go are being double-taxed because they have to pay for their seats. It's a Coney Island scam.''\\nThe most prominent student of the financial effect of ballparks on their surrounding neighborhoods is a Harvard-trained Smith College economist named Andrew Zimbalist, the editor, with Roger Noll, of ''Sports, Jobs and Taxes.'' Zimbalist says that while it is reasonable for a community to claim there are ''cultural benefits'' to having a minor-league stadium in its midst, ''there is simply no economic argument for the city as a whole to subsidize a ballpark at Coney Island on economic grounds.''\\nNaturally, Mayor Giuliani considers this the worst sort of prevarication. ''Andrew Zimbalist is Castro's economist,'' he says. ''He does not understand a capitalist economy.'' The point, the mayor explains, is that the ballpark ''allows people to rediscover Coney Island. It's a way of showing off Coney Island so people come back for other things besides baseball.'' As to why there was no referendum for taxpayers to say whether or not they wanted to build Fred Wilpon and George Steinbrenner these new minor-league ballparks, the mayor's answer is: ''Because they would have voted it down. That's why you need a leader. Somebody who has some vision.'' His legacy, he says, will be forging ''the anchor of the economic redevelopment of two neighborhoods that desperately need it.''\\nIn the sleek Fifth Avenue skyscraper where his company, Sterling Equities, keeps its headquarters, Fred Wilpon considered this modern phenomenon of municipalities building ballparks for team owners to use in private enterprise. ''I know what economists say,'' Wilpon said, ''but I also know what the history is when baseball teams vacate a city.'' It was then suggested to him that, in this case, nobody was leaving. The minor-league teams, in fact, seemed to want nothing more than to come to New York. Wasn't the city needlessly paying for him to turn a profit? Couldn't he have built his own ballpark and still made out fine? Wouldn't he maybe even have forgone some of the profits just for the satisfaction of helping out the old neighborhood?\\nWilpon was on his way to a meeting. Pausing in his building's Italian marble lobby, he stood there, in a pinstriped bespoke suit stitched for him by a tailor who has also outfitted several presidents, and considered his motives with the Cyclones. Since this is baseball today, they are a mingle of pleasures and profits. ''It wasn't all money,'' he said. ''I have a passion for this. I would have done it if I knew we'd break even.'' Then he mused: ''If I knew we'd lose money, would I have done it? Probably. Yes. On an emotional basis, not on a business basis.''\\n\", \"IN the window of a video store on Bedford Avenue in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, hangs a poster for the 1968 film ''Chitty Chitty Bang Bang,'' in which a young boy and girl enter a land curiously devoid of children. Seeing the offending visitors, the townspeople gasp in horror, and the young pair are soon spirited away by a gaunt, long-haired man in tight black clothes.\\nA similar gasp could be heard two months ago in Williamsburg, home to many gaunt people in tight clothes, when a Bedford Avenue storefront that had long housed the local art supply store reopened as Sam & Seb, the neighborhood's first baby store.\\n''It's deplorable,'' said Sean Kennerly, a Williamsburg writer who watched in despair as the stenciled words ''Discount Art Supplies'' disappeared under a coat of shocking pink paint. ''It's one more sign of the deterioration of the neighborhood. You always figure there are places for people who want to have kids. Like over in Park Slope.''\\nBabies have long been a fixture in the area's Latino, Polish and Hasidic communities. But the pioneering artists and those who followed them to Williamsburg in the last 20 years seemed to float above such corporeal concerns as pregnancy and child-rearing. They were known for pierced navels and creative facial hair, for cigarette-filled afternoons and all-night roof parties.\\nTheir coolness made headlines across the country, drawing others to the industrial-chic streets and causing The Utne Reader to declare Williamsburg the third hippest neighborhood in America (after the Lower Garden District in New Orleans and the Inner Mission District in San Francisco). A sexy convergence of grit and glam, Williamsburg was hardly a place for miniature pudgy people who slobbered food down their shirts and were too young to smoke.\\n''I moved here 11 years ago from Park Slope to get away from all the babies,'' said an actor-contractor who asked that his name not be used. ''You walked up Seventh Avenue, and you had to wiggle yourself to get past stroller after stroller.''\\nOnce, he and others like him were safe. As recently as five years ago, babies were a relatively rare sight in hipster Williamsburg. Then, about two years ago, they started to pour out of the warehouses and onto the sidewalks.\\nSigns of change abound. The Williamsburg Northside Preschool on North Fifth Street, which started with three children in 1999, is expecting more than 100 in September and will move to a bigger space this week. The number of children taking classes at the Stable, a local dance studio, increased from three or four in 1997 to 72 today, and the studio offers pre- and postnatal yoga. Tops on the Waterfront, a neighborhood supermarket, reports increased sales of baby oils, soaps and organic foods.\\nEven people having babies have been taken aback by the explosion. Kate Murphy, a 36-year-old advertising director who lives in the area, recalled seeing ''the odd stroller on Bedford getting weird looks from the Calvin Klein models,'' and when she became pregnant last year, she said, ''I didn't know that this was the right place necessarily to have a baby.'' Watching preparations for the new baby store, she thought, ''I'll be your only customer.''\\nTo Ms. Murphy and others like her, the store is a godsend. It's not just the snakeskin bibs, the Jane's Addiction onesies or the installation art of multicolored baby heads in the window that make Williamsburg's new parents feel at home. It's also the relief at finding a local hangout where they can meet like-minded others.\\n''New mums come here, and they just hang out for hours,'' said Simone Manwarring, one of the owners. ''They sit here and breast-feed. They know we're not going to say, 'You can't use our bathroom.' It's sort of like a safe zone.''\\nMs. Manwarring, a local art exhibition coordinator, opened the store with Amanda Williamson, an artist neighbor. The two first-time mothers got the idea after too many treks to Manhattan in search of both baby items and contact with other mothers. Nevertheless, even they were surprised by the response when they posted a sign-up sheet inviting new mothers to bring their babies to the shop for a get-together.\\n''I thought we'd have maybe 3 mothers, but we got 18,'' Ms. Manwarring said as her 15-month-old son, Sam, toddled about on the store's brightly colored floor tiles. A few days later, the list shot up to 30.\\nPeeling Paint Isn't Baby-Friendly\\nOn the morning of the first ''new mums'' meeting (so termed by Ms. Manwarring, an Australian, and Ms. Williamson, who is South African), women spread out on the floor, sipping mint tea and guava juice, playing with babies or rubbing bellies that contained them. They heard presentations by Shirly Weiss, a holistic nutritionist, and by Philippa Woolley, who runs the Stable.\\nAfterward, the women discussed the drawbacks to breeding in the 'hood: the raised eyebrows; the power plants, waste transfer stations, and other pollution sources; the artists' lofts whose flaking paint and soaring windows are hardly child-friendly.\\n''Our landlord said babies don't belong in Williamsburg,'' said Ms. Murphy, sitting on the floor with her daughter, Isabel, who is just a few weeks old. ''It's the kind of building where a lot of artists live, and I think she didn't want to deal with it.''\\nMs. Woolley nodded. ''We had a home birth,'' she said, ''but we didn't tell our landlords.''\\nStill, these new mothers are not about to leave Williamsburg. Most lived here long before becoming pregnant, and they don't mind being icebreakers. They are in their 30's, they are finished with the dating scene, and they are less concerned with the neighborhood's cool quotient than with fighting for more parks and better education. Williamsburg's public schools score badly on citywide tests, and a parents group has received a $25,000 grant to start a local charter school, although they have yet to get approval from the city.\\nIt is not hard to spot more subtle changes on local streets. The staff at Hello Beautiful, a new, psychedelically painted hair salon, entertain clients' babies during haircuts. Wythe Avenue's sleek, silver Relish diner, the locus of many a film shoot, most recently the one for ''Angels in America,'' recently invested in a wooden highchair. The Brooklyn Brewery on North 11th Street holds a smoke-free Friday night open house at which babies make their way around the gleaming beer tanks as their parents swig microbrew and shoot pool.\\nDiscussions about babies in Williamsburg inevitably turn to the subject of gentrification. But longtime residents point to escalating real estate prices as the true culprit, and note that many of the local residents having babies are artists who have lived there for years. Many of them are also the owners of the places that helped make the neighborhood hip in the first place.\\n''All the bars the hipsters hang out at, the L Cafe, Pete's Candy Store, the Girdle Factory, Earwax, their owners are all having babies,'' Ms. Manwarring said. ''Everyone who owns all these businesses that they like, all the people they admire in the neighborhood.''\\nReminders of Mortality, or of Suburbia\\nHere is Williamsburg's take on babies, based on comments that Steve DeRiseis, Ms. Manwarring's husband, heard last month as he stood on a ladder painting the baby store.\\nThose who made snide ''There goes the neighborhood'' comments were typically young and male. Longtime residents told him they were glad about the change, especially that the space was not going to become another new bar. Perhaps most surprisingly, childless women in their 20's loved the idea.\\n''It's amazing,'' said Ms. Manwarring, whose long red hair and upturned nose make her look more like a bright-eyed schoolgirl than a grown-up mother. ''There's so many young women who come in here who don't have babies and aren't close to having babies. And they buy stuff for the baby they'll have one day. They go nuts. They go absolutely gaga.''\\nThe singer Bjork, who is pregnant, spent 45 minutes in the store one day, buying not baby clothes but 11 finger puppets. Ms. Williamson found this interesting. ''I didn't think Bjork had 11 fingers,'' she said.\\nYoung men are a harder sell. To many, babies are a drooling refutation of their commitment-free lives, a reminder of their mortality. Not to mention that strollers and baby bottles look frighteningly like suburbia.\\nSitting surrounded by motorcycles at a sidewalk table at Relish, Mr. Kennerly, 34, insisted that he had nothing against babies per se. ''The Polish and Hispanics have been raising their kids here for years,'' he said. ''That doesn't bother me. It's fine to have procreative impulses as long as you don't inflict them on the neighborhood.'' What bothers him about what he calls the ''yuppie babies'' is the ''assertive cuteness'' imposed on them by their parents.\\n''I think upper-middle-class people have a much more narcissistic involvement with their kids than poor people,'' said Mr. Kennerly, who grew up in Texas and Colorado (and whose discussion of babies was sprinkled liberally with curses). ''It's the gurgling and the cooing that I can't stand. People just don't let their kids be. They're convinced that their kid is the most amazing thing that ever happened on the planet. But I didn't realize how dire the situation had become'' until the baby store opened.\\n''When the baby stores open,'' he said, ''you know the bourgeois has the neighborhood firmly in its grasp.''\\nMontgomery Knott, a lanky music producer who favors beach hats and low-slung jeans, found it bizarre to see strollers on industrial streets that were recently the domain of prostitutes, though he added, ''At some point I'm sure it was pretty bizarre to see children on the cobblestones of SoHo.''\\nHe wasn't bothered by the babies until a couple of months ago, when he bought a new apartment. A couple with a 5-month-old moved in next door, and suddenly the late-night, video-enhanced ''listening parties'' on Mr. Knott's mattress-strewn floor were interrupted by knocks on the door and appeals for quiet.\\n''What are people thinking?'' he said. ''Do they think they're moving into Park Slope or something? I'm interested as a homeowner in the value of my space, and I know that families bring in value.'' But there are limits. ''Anyone,'' he said, ''even in the suburbs, should be allowed to throw a blowout party.''\\nHighchairs Amid Smokers\\nLast weekend at Sam & Seb's opening party, as strollers gridlocked outside and pink and white balloons strained against their strings, a tall man with a mohawk, a nose ring and a silver front tooth watched his small son and daughter run around. A woman with tattooed arms and a guitar sang upbeat children's songs, courtesy of ''Music for Aardvarks,'' a local children's music program. An infant in a Sex Pistols T-shirt crawled across the floor.\\n''It's kind of hard to believe: we grow older and have kids,'' said Dan Siegler, a new father and the owner of the L Cafe, an art- and artist-filled establishment ever since it opened a decade ago next to the L train stop.\\nNow Mr. Siegler was at Sam & Seb, handing out fliers announcing the L's new children's menu, which started last week and lists crayons, highchairs and ''Baby-ccinos'' (steamed milk with foam served with animal crackers).\\nNot all of Mr. Siegler's employees share his vision.\\n''When we talk about where the cafe is going,'' he said, ''I'm talking about a kids' menu, and they're talking about D.J.'s and sangria.'' Part of that is attributable to a generation gap: he is 39, and many of his employees are still in their teens. But Mr. Siegler also sees baby stores and children's menus as part of a natural evolution, much like the changes that transformed SoHo and Greenwich Village.\\n''Every few months there's this fear that it will no longer be everyone's little stretch of bohemian paradise,'' he said, referring to a recent series of Starbucks scares. ''Ultimately, that's going to happen, and ultimately the people who gentrify the neighborhood are the ones who complain loudest about the degree to which it gets gentrified.''\\nBut it's not just about ideology. There are more practical objections to the baby boom.\\n''They're messy and they're annoying,'' said Amy Chin, a 23-year-old waitress at Diner, a local restaurant. ''It's a smoking bar, and people bring their babies in there at 11 at night. Who does that?''\\nWhile Williamsburg parents don't necessarily subscribe to traditional mind-sets about the hours babies should keep or the places they should frequent, everyone seems to agree that babies and smoking don't mix.\\nThe father with the mohawk and nose ring at Sam & Seb was wearing a nicotine patch. Mr. Siegler, who quit smoking four years ago, says smoking is the stickiest issue at his cafe as the highchairs are pulled out more and more often amid the all-day blue haze.\\n''I would love to make it a no-smoking restaurant,'' Mr. Siegler said. ''People say we'll lose all our smoking clientele, but my feeling is those people would be replaced by people who don't smoke and want to eat and spend money rather than sitting for three hours over a cappuccino.''\\nTo that, Mr. Kennerly said, ''My reaction is just: 'Yuck.' ''\\nIn ''Chitty Chitty Bang Bang,'' the adults-only spell is finally broken when hordes of children rise from their hiding places in the sewers, causing mayhem in the royal court as they reclaim their rightful place. While Williamsburg's change of heart may be slightly less dramatic, it is nevertheless happening as the baby-to-hipster ratio threatens to approach parity.\\nWith so many babies parading around, is Williamsburg in danger of losing its ''third hippest'' status?\\n''You know, I hope it does,'' said Mr. Siegler, the owner of the L. ''Hipness has long become uninteresting. It's an uninteresting thing to aspire to. If you spend all your time trying to preserve that, then how cool can you possibly be?''\\nAside from a few hostile comments, new parents say the neighborhood has a friendly, small-town feeling that seemed to increase when they had their babies.\\nSome say they feel a deeper connection to the neighboring ethnic communities. ''The Mexicans next door, they just can't believe that this white person is having a baby,'' said a very pregnant blond woman at the new mothers' meeting. ''They talk to me now.''\\nAnd that actor who moved from Park Slope to escape the strollers? There was a reason he didn't want his name used. Not long ago, he and his girlfriend built a small wooden annex to their bed. They needed to make room. For a baby.\\n\", \"An guide to cultural and recreational goings-on around the state this week.

Young children, up late.\\nThe phenomenon is clear to anyone who visits the city's streets, subways, stores and fast-food restaurants after 10 p.m. Summer is prime time for the wee hours, and the city that never sleeps is filled with children who seem not to sleep enough.\\nLate August is also when school looms and, experts say, when parents most need to ease their children into earlier bedtimes. But schoolbooks were a distant thought at 1:30 a.m. on a recent Thursday in Times Square.\\nOn that night, seven cousins, 3 to 15, transformed the corner of 42nd Street and Seventh Avenue into a playground as they laughed, shouted and swung from low-hanging scaffolding. Supervising the rowdily friendly bunch was their grandmother, Shirley Ann Quintero, and her husband, Jose Saavedra.\\n''When I was little, my dad used to bring me out to play the arcades in Times Square, so I decided to bring my kids out and do the same thing,'' said Ms. Quintero, who lives in the same building as her charges on the Grand Concourse in the Bronx. The special occasion justified the late hours, she said.\\nAs the Quintero clan swung from the scaffolding, Ahmed Farraj, 10, and his family entered a nearby subway station. They had just been to see the movie ''Signs'' and were headed home to Sunset Park, Brooklyn. Despite the late hour, Ahmed was not tired, he said.\\n''You know why?'' he asked. ''Because the lights, they're too shiny, and it looks like it is not even dark yet. It looks like it's the morning.''\\nIn Astoria, Queens, Yehia Ghazi, a gregarious Egyptian immigrant, also understands the powerful draw of the city's bright lights. ''I love the night,'' he said. His children, Khalid, 7, and Khloud, 5, are also developing a taste for it. ''They go to bed at 12:30 or 1'' on school nights, he said. ''If you wake up at 7:30, that's enough sleep.'' During the summer, he added, they are up even later.\\nThere have been no studies of the sleep habits of the youngest New Yorkers. Impressions can be misleading, too, and not just because a late night may be a rarity rather than a routine. A child playing outside an apartment building late at night will be seen by hundreds; a suburban child logging onto the Internet from a bedroom is nearly invisible. Also, naturally, there are plenty of New York City homes where early bedtimes are alive and well.\\nStill, experts offer several reasons why early bedtimes for children may be scarcer in New York than elsewhere.\\nFor starters, city dwellers have always been night owls. ''There's more competition for sleep'' in urban areas, said Dr. Judith Owens, director of the Pediatric Sleep Disorders Clinic at Hasbro Children's Hospital in Providence, R.I. ''It's much more of an artificial environment. There's stuff going on 24 hours a day. Stores are open, parents are working. There's just much less reliance on your natural circadian rhythms.''\\nAt most hours of the night, New Yorkers can buy books, rent videos, work out, eat Korean barbecue, even be arraigned in Manhattan Criminal Court, which is open all night three nights a week.\\nFor workers, too, New York is a sleepless town. ''New York City has more 24-hour operations than your average city,'' said Dr. Jack Connolly, president of Shiftwork Consultants, a firm in Port Washington, N.Y., that advises around-the-clock businesses.\\nBodega and transit workers are obvious examples, but old-school manufacturers, like the Domino Sugar plant in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, also tend to run all night. Even for lawyers, secretaries and others who work regular hours, ambitious New York is just not a 9 to 5 place.\\n''The economy doesn't close down at night,'' said Mitchell L. Moss, director of the Taub Urban Research Center at New York University. ''So what's happened is that many parents do not come home until late in the evening and that's when they spend time with their kids, doing chores, helping with homework or shopping.''\\nThese urban characteristics are accompanied by other, more general social pressures that can mean less sleep for children, from the trend to more homework to the multiplying number of computer games and television shows. Combined, these forces raise the specter that bedtimes for city children, already late, may grow later.\\nBusy Parents, Busy Children\\nDr. Laura Popper, an associate professor at Mount Sinai Medical School and a pediatrician who primarily deals with upper-middle-class families in her private practice, often observes busy parents trying to carve out time to spend with equally busy children.\\n''If you're an investment banker and work incredibly long hours,'' she said, ''something's going to have to give.'' Even for parents who achieve what experts advise -- giving elementary-school children regular bedtimes and 9 to 11 hours of sleep a night -- the task can be exhausting.\\nLiz Swig, who lives on the Upper East Side, feels lucky if she can get her sons, Simon, 11, and Oliver, 7, to bed at 10 and 9:30, respectively. They do not frequent the streets or play many video games; their lives are just busy. Between the two, there's tennis two days a week, soccer, art class and Hebrew school. Last year, Simon had up to an hour and a half of homework as a fifth grader at the Horace Mann School, in Riverdale in the Bronx. Oh, and there is the small matter of eating dinner.\\n''There's no time for them to try to just chill out,'' Ms. Swig said. ''Conceptually, children need their sleep. But it's very hard to do it.''\\nBy the time Simon's daily whirlwind is done, it's almost 10, but Ms. Swig allows him to stay up a little longer.\\n''Don't you think he deserves downtime?'' she asked. ''Don't you think he deserves the equivalent of his glass of wine a day?''\\nLike the Swigs, many parents, especially in middle-class neighborhoods, list a litany of school and extracurricular activities. But even when they are done, bedtime is not necessarily quick in coming. ''I see kids who really are burdened with hours and hours and hours of work,'' Dr. Popper said. ''They really can't wind down from it, so they're awake.'' Experts say quiet time before bed is important for good rest.\\nThe Night Shift\\nDaysi Mel\\xc3\\xa9ndez can understand these pressures. A Honduran immigrant raising three children on her own, Ms. Mel\\xc3\\xa9ndez works 4 to 10 p.m. three days a week in a Laundromat in Park Slope, Brooklyn. On her days off, she insists that the kids be in bed by 9. But when she works, it is not until 10:45 or so that she picks them up at the baby sitter's house in Bushwick, Brooklyn, where Ms. Mel\\xc3\\xa9ndez lives.\\nShe says she knows this pattern is not good for the children, that they may not be able to concentrate in school. ''The poor kids go to bed at midnight, by the time they take a bath and I change them,'' she said. ''It's hard, but it's necessary. It's temporary, just for now.''\\nBut there is nothing temporary about the work schedule of Mr. Ghazi. ''All my life I work nights,'' he said, adding that he always will. When his family first joined him from Egypt in 2000, he drove a bakery truck on the 2-a.m.-to-noon shift. The only time he had for his family was at night before work, and the kids often stayed up until he left. He would teach them English words or tell them stories in Arabic.\\nNow Mr. Ghazi works in an East Village restaurant, Sahara East, from 5 p.m. to 4 a.m. He sees his children when they come home from school and on Monday, his day off. But the family's late nights continue.\\nOn a recent Monday evening, Mr. Ghazi and his wife, Amal Monsor, were in their small three-bedroom apartment on a quiet Astoria street. It was 11 p.m., and the two children were sitting on the couch, watching an Egyptian movie on satellite television. The living room was decorated with images of Ramses and Nefertiti, enlarged passages from the Koran and eight clocks.\\nIn the next hour and a half, Khalid played the video game ''Fighting Force 2'' on his Playstation, studied his Pok\\xc3\\xa9mon cards and tuned in stations on his Walkman. Khloud lay on her parents' bed, flipped through Dr. Seuss's ''Foot Book'' and played with stuffed animals, including a gorilla, a baby giraffe and an eyeless Kermit the Frog.\\nThe children were energetic and adorable, but they began to falter by 12:30 a.m. Drifting toward the bedroom where they share a colorful bunk bed, they began looking through a collection of picture books.\\nAt 12:50 a.m., back in the living room, Khloud announced she wanted to go to sleep, but with a catch. She wanted her older brother to come to bed too. Khalid was not tired, but Mr. Ghazi ordered him to go with Khloud wait until she fell asleep and then come back. Khloud collapsed on the lower bunk, face down. Khalid leaned against the yellow bunk ladder, reading ''Huggly's Snow Day.'' The eyeless Kermit sat in the corner. About 1:15, after a brief return to the living room when his sister had dropped off, Khalid went to bed.\\nSuch patterns are familiar to Dr. Owens. She has studied the sleep habits of lower-income children from the Providence area, and said her findings also apply to New York and other big cities with large immigrant populations.\\n''A large number of these kids have parents working two jobs or three jobs, and many working a night shift,'' Dr. Owens said. ''There isn't anybody to supervise bedtime, and bedtime in the families isn't really a structured concept.''\\nSuch a pattern can be a problem. A recent study of 187 elementary-school children in two-parent homes by Dr. Jodi Mindell, associate director of the Sleep Disorder Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, shows that children's sleep is affected in families in which at least one parent does not work a typical 9-to-5 day.\\nSummer in the City\\nOn a recent hot evening in Washington Heights, kids swarmed outside, riding scooters, sitting on stoops, eating Chinese takeout and playing basketball.\\nThe Heights is one of the city's most densely populated neighborhoods, so for every kid in the street after midnight there were probably many more tucked in bed. But the sheer number of kids outside in this area on a steamy night makes every corner look like a day care center. On some blocks, speakers blare merengue or bachata so loud from windows that it is hard to imagine anybody inside the building asleep.\\nYou are never too young to join this party. About midnight on a recent Sunday, three strollers stood unoccupied at Audubon Avenue and 178th Street. They belonged to Shaunoly P\\xc3\\xa9rez, 2; Justin Minaya, 1; and Aliyah Beltr\\xc3\\xa9, 1. With encouragement from her mother, Valerie Malav\\xc3\\xa9, Aliyah wiggled her hips to a merengue song by Sergio Vargas. The children's parents and grandparents egged her on, and Aliyah smiled.\\nAsked why Shaunoly was not in bed, her mother, Charo P\\xc3\\xa9rez, was defensive. ''Today's the only day she's breaking night, so I can spend some time with my parents,'' she said, saying Shaunoly's usual bedtime is around 10.\\nThis scene is at once strange and familiar to Jose Beltr\\xc3\\xa9, Aliyah's father. He grew up in Washington Heights and remembers wishing his parents would go upstairs so he could go to sleep. But since he moved, things are different. ''I live in Florida and I don't see my neighbors,'' he said.\\nHis wife, Ms. Malav\\xc3\\xa9, added, ''There's not really that hanging out that you do here.''\\nA few blocks away, Henry S\\xc3\\xa1nchez made the rounds on his scooter, despite the occasional admonition from his father, Luis, to stay nearby. Many members of the S\\xc3\\xa1nchez family were gathered outside their Audubon Avenue building.\\n''Let's consider something,'' Mr. S\\xc3\\xa1nchez said when asked about the street scene. ''The heat. Not everyone has their little air-conditioner.''\\nChurch is another reason for staying up late. In Washington Heights and other immigrant and minority neighborhoods, some children attend Pentecostal churches on weekday evenings. The Rev. Adalberto De Jesus of the Church of God, on Crotona Avenue near East Tremont Avenue in the East Tremont area of the Bronx, said that years ago he scaled back his Wednesday services to end no later than 9:45 p.m. He wanted the children, usually about a third of his 30 or 35 Wednesday worshipers, to return home.\\nBut, he said, many other churches are not as conscientious. ''I don't think they realize the full negative effect that is happening,'' he said. ''On the other hand, if you're going to weigh the positive and the negative, there are more positives than negatives from the effect church has on children.''\\nStaying up late in the summer is not a big problem, Dr. Mindell said, as long as the child does not have to wake up early for camp or day care and gets enough sleep over all.\\nBut, she warned, children who make a quick switch as school starts will have troubles. ''Parents need to realize that the transition cannot happen overnight from a summer sleep schedule to a school sleep schedule,'' she said. She compared it to jet lag after flying from California to New York.\\n''With some of these kids,'' she added, ''it's more like they're on Hawaii time.''\\n\", \"Correction Appended\\nAt Engine Company 204 in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn, the police used two vans to cart away 12 protesters who had invaded the firehouse to keep it alive. At Engine Company 212 in Williamsburg, protesters rushed in and jammed pieces of lumber to prop open the door. One man chained himself to the bumper of the fire truck, and others sat down in front of it. Eight people were arrested.\\nAfter months of debate and legal battles, the city closed six fire companies yesterday in Brooklyn, Queens and Manhattan. Several of the closings went smoothly, although bitterness and sadness lingered outside the buildings' front doors. But confrontations in Harlem and Brooklyn exposed emotions so raw that their intensity surprised the police officers and fire officials on hand to keep order on the overcast Sunday morning.\\nThe six companies -- four in Brooklyn, one in Manhattan and one in Queens -- had been ordered to close down and cease responding to radio calls at 0900 hours, or 9 a.m. The city had long argued that in these six cases, other fire companies nearby could respond to emergencies just as quickly, and the overlap of coverage was too expensive in such perilous financial times.\\nThere were hugs, tears and somber goodbyes among residents and firefighters at the firehouses where the order was quietly followed. At Engine Company 209 in Bedford-Stuyvesant, the closing barely interrupted the firefighters' morning coffee and treadmill workouts.\\nAt Engine Company 36 in East Harlem, however, protesters chanted angrily. Waving banners reading ''They Go, We Die,'' they lined up in front of the house and blocked firefighters from parking the fire truck inside.\\nMayor Michael R. Bloomberg, speaking to reporters in Forest Hills, Queens, reiterated his contention that the closings would not pose a safety threat to local residents. He said that all of the firefighters were being reassigned and that the six companies had been chosen carefully by fire chiefs because ''all of them are reasonably close to other firehouses.''\\nThese were the first firehouse closings in the city in more than a decade, and the mayor faced political opposition, lawsuits and no small criticism over them. But the mayor, who was lightly booed at two Memorial Day parades yesterday in Queens, has maintained that this is a politically tough but necessary measure to balance the city's budget.\\nClosing firehouses has never been easy. In 1991, four days after Mayor David N. Dinkins ordered the controversial closing of Engine Company 294, in Richmond Hill, Queens, two brothers died in a house fire nine blocks away. Rudolph W. Giuliani seized on the issue when he ran against Mr. Dinkins for mayor in 1993, and reopened the firehouse shortly after he became mayor.\\nOn Saturday, a man rammed a white van into the front doors of four firehouses in Brooklyn. One firehouse door was jammed shut, preventing firefighters from responding to two calls. None of those firehouses were among the ones scheduled to be closed.\\nAs of yesterday, officials had not found the driver or speculated on his motive. But there was talk among firefighters that the incident could have been an attempt to keep the city from closing the four Brooklyn firehouses by disabling others that would assume their duties.\\nThe 20 people who were arrested yesterday were charged with criminal trespassing and disorderly conduct, said Firefighter Robert Calise, a spokesman for the department.\\nAt the firehouses that drew protests, demonstrators began arriving before 8 a.m., carrying coffee cups, waving signs and pushing baby strollers.\\nAbout 200 people gathered outside Engine Company 204 in Cobble Hill. There were parents, politicians, activists. There was a Sept. 11 widow, and there was the actor Steve Buscemi, a former city firefighter who lives in Brooklyn.\\nA handful of demonstrators began to voice outrage that the firehouse was being closed. Others put down their coffee and began chanting along. Speakers began lambasting Mr. Bloomberg's decision, and the gathering grew heated. Just before 9 a.m., protesters linked arms in front of the building, preventing the firefighters from leaving. A fire captain from the house, Brenda Berkman, stuck her head out a window and joined in the criticism of the mayor.\\nBy 11:15, the protesters were storming the firehouse and opening the large door so others could enter. Just after noon, police officers arrived and began making arrests.\\nAt Engine Company 212 in Williamsburg, there were about 100 protesters by 8 a.m., chanting in English, Polish and Spanish and setting up sidewalk barbecues to grill hamburgers. Two conga drummers arrived and began beating out rhythms.\\nSuddenly, Paul Veneski, 38, of Williamsburg, an unemployed truck driver, slipped into the firehouse through an open cellar door and opened the garage's large red door. Other protesters -- among them Bronislawa Hupalo, a rail-thin 80-year-old -- charged in and struggled to jam it open with discarded lumber. .\\nMr. Veneski then chained himself to the fire truck. His 12-year-old daughter, Jennifer, cheered him on. Later in the three-hour standoff, she offered her father hamburgers through a small space in the door.\\nApparently, trying to save firehouses runs in the Veneski family. Mr. Veneski's father, Adam Veneski, a local grocer, stormed this very firehouse when it was threatened with closing in 1975, the family said.\\nAt Engine Company 36 in East Harlem, about a dozen protesters chanted against the closing. A sarcastic ''For Rent'' sign on the door listed some of the building's assets: ''Eat-In Kitchen, Covered Parking, Sliding Pole.''\\nAlthough unhappy to see them go, the protesters cheered the firefighters as they carried out their gear.\\nLee Decker, 35, a firefighter with Engine 36, said that many firefighters from the company, both active and retired, spent the night at the house, rehashing memories and deciding who would keep communal possessions bought with their own money, including a washer-dryer, dishwasher, refrigerators, couches, televisions, stereos, VCR's and an extensive collection of exercise equipment.\\n''They're breaking up a big family here,'' Firefighter Decker said.\\nIn Sunset Park, Brooklyn, a small group of teary-eyed firefighters and residents gathered outside Engine Company 278 at 9 a.m., not so much in protest as in resignation. As they hugged each other, Brian Horan, 48, of Sunset Park, a 13-year veteran with the company, loaded his belongings into his car.\\n''I think it's a disgrace to the members of the force who died in 9/11,'' he said. ''It's a slap in their face.''\\nThe scene yesterday seemed just as poignant at Engine Company 261 in Long Island City, Queens. It shared a firehouse with Ladder Company 116, so the house itself would be staying open.\\nAt 8:30 a.m., a handful of firefighters there sat dolefully on the bumper of their truck and listened to local Democratic elected officials criticizing Mr. Bloomberg and Gov. George E. Pataki for cuts in financing.\\nAt 9 a.m., Deputy Fire Chief John Acerno conducted a somber roll call, saluting their efforts and ''dedication, loyalty and many sacrifices.''\\nBy the end, some firefighters were in tears.\\nCorrection: May 28, 2003, Wednesday  A picture caption on Monday with an article about the closing of six fire companies in New York City gave a misspelled surname in some copies for Assemblywoman Joan Millman's chief of staff, who was among those who protested outside Engine Company 204 in Brooklyn. She is Corrina Freedman, not Friedman.\\n\", \"Those who live by Bedford Avenue and South Fourth Street in Brooklyn had their 11th-mile welcoming all set for the New York City Marathon runners yesterday. Salsa music blasting from a top-floor window filled the street, volunteers lined up to hand out water and spectators held up signs for the runners.\\n''Victoria, the runners,'' Maria Molina told her 5-year-old daughter, who sat in a small lawn chair, as the first female runners passed.\\nFor Molina and others who live nearby, the marathon is more than an annual event. It has become a neighborhood tradition.\\nSeveral of her family members gather every year to hand out water and cheer on the runners. Molina's mother makes chicken soup and hot chocolate for the neighbors, and they play the salsa music from Molina's home.\\nMolina's father first began hydrating runners with a hose 20 years ago, then became captain of the 11th-mile water station, which runners pass just after the Williamsburg Bridge. Her brother-in-law, John Alfaro, is now a co-captain.\\n''It is something we grew up with,'' Molina said. ''It is something we do every year. It is part of our neighborhood.''\\nMelissa Gonzalez, 20, has been volunteering at the water stations on Bedford Avenue since she was 7. Gonzalez's grandmother, who died two years ago, first signed her up as a volunteer. Gonzalez said the marathon played a big role in the neighborhood.\\n''You see more and more people coming out to help,'' she said.\\nDown the street from Gonzalez, about 20 members of the El Regreso Foundation, a drug recovery program, dispensed water. The men held orange tape to keep spectators from walking into the runners' paths and cheered the runners.\\n''Keep going, baby!'' one Regreso volunteer yelled. ''Just a little longer guys!''\\nHanding out water was a new experience for Juan Yambo, who has been a resident of the Regreso program for eight months.\\n''I was not especially involved in these types of activities,'' he said. ''It's good for us.''\\nYambo found inspiration from the wheelchair athletes, who were the first to go by his station. ''I was impressed because even with their impediment, they can accomplish so much,'' he said.\\nGabrielle Steiner, a member of the Hasidic community in Williamsburg, stood by South Fifth Street watching with her daughters Miriam Gluck, 22, and Bella Englander, 23, who were each pushing a stroller. Steiner remembered watching the marathon with her own daughters in strollers. She said she watched the marathon from different locations within Williamsburg to get a feel for the community.\\n''Each year I move up a couple of blocks,'' Steiner said.\\nJesus Molina, Maria's uncle, has watched the marathon from Bedford Avenue since it started going through, he said. Although the people who gather to watch there are still mostly Latino, especially Puerto Rican, he said he had seen the community diversify.\\nNils Almquist, 29, who moved to Bedford Avenue by South Fifth Street last year, had 11 friends over to watch with him outside his apartment building. Almquist and his girlfriend, Tara Swanson, set up a table with bagels, pomegranates, mimosas and bloody marys. They were already making plans for next year.\\n''Next year there will be a little more preparation,'' Swanson said.\\nFor Priya and Sandhya Seshan, who have been living in Williamsburg for six years, the marathon is a time for sisterly bonding. They usually have breakfast on marathon day and watch together from Bedford Avenue.\\n''All right, 222!'' yelled Priya Seshan, 29, who plans to run the marathon next year. She said she liked to motivate the runners.\\n''I focus on the people who get tired, I call out their names,'' she said. ''Maybe it gives them more strength to keep going.''\\nMayra Laro tried to give the runners strength with oranges. For the third year, Laro offered the runners sections of oranges from the sidewalk. She stood with her 2-year-old daughter and her 5- and 11-year-old sons by South Sixth Street. She woke up early yesterday to cut 75 oranges.\\n''I like to help them and I want my children to continue the tradition,'' she said in Spanish. ''Maybe in the future they can run in it, too.''\\n\", \"Correction Appended\\nSabato F. Catucci stalks the piers on the Red Hook waterfront in Brooklyn, where he has built a thriving business handling cargo containers, lumber, coffee and cacao beans. Mr. Catucci, the owner of American Stevedoring, has plans for a liquor distribution center on Pier 12, where his company would unload beer and spirits bound for Brooklyn, Queens and Long Island, bringing hundreds of new jobs to Red Hook.\\nBut last month, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey told him it would not extend his lease of Piers 6 through 12 beyond April, while it explored ''alternative uses for the property.'' Though Representative Jerrold Nadler says he may have persuaded the Port Authority to grant a temporary reprieve, the longer-term fight to save Mr. Catucci's maritime operation is just one skirmish in a battle raging through Red Hook and neighboring Gowanus over the future of the hardscrabble area.\\nThe small manufacturers, distributors and businesspeople who have helped revive that stretch of the Brooklyn waterfront in the last decade say the city and the Port Authority are writing off the area's maritime and industrial base in favor of a future filled with luxurious waterfront apartments featuring spectacular views of Manhattan and Governors Island. They say rents have risen sharply and speculators are holding industrial properties off the market in the belief that the city will rezone the area for residential development -- a move they contend will make it all but impossible for many of these companies, and thousands of jobs, to survive.\\nThe struggle mirrors what is happening in Long Island City, Queens, and Greenpoint and Williamsburg, Brooklyn, where gentrification and a shift to residential zoning are under way, worrying manufacturers who provide blue-collar jobs.\\n''This is in many ways the most complex land-use battle in the city,'' Deputy Mayor Daniel L. Doctoroff said of Red Hook. ''You've got competing uses, with tradeoffs between jobs, waterfront access, housing, retail jobs and industrial jobs. It requires a very textured approach.''\\nHe and other city officials say that a good number of Red Hook's buildings sit unused or underused, so the city and Port Authority are studying the area to determine how to make the transition from an industrial waterfront to an office-based economy. They will not say whether they envision luxury apartments, though they say they favor a mixed-use neighborhood where residential and commercial developments coexist.\\nBut the small-business owners say coexistence is a pipe dream. A boom for luxury apartments will price them out of the neighborhood, they say, and the new developers and residents will have little tolerance for the gritty realities of a working waterfront.\\n''People who live in Red Hook depend on these jobs; they're willing to put up with the truck traffic and the congestion,'' said Igor Katsman, vice president for operations for Snapple Distribution, which rents warehouse space and employs 250 workers. ''But when you start putting up $500,000 condominiums, those people don't want trucks on the streets.''\\nIn the meantime, Mr. Katsman said, he fears that the uncertainty over the area's future will put him out of business. ''Nobody wants to give us a long-term lease because they're all speculating that the zoning will be changed to residential,'' he said.\\nMr. Doctoroff said that the city and Port Authority expect to complete their latest study on the future of Piers 6 through 12 sometime this month. He also said that Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg plans this spring to issue the city's long-awaited policy on preserving industrial space citywide.\\nBut there is an increasing fear at Community Board 6, whose district includes Red Hook, that the Bloomberg administration has a different vision for the neighborhood. Last month, the city granted a variance to convert four floors of a six-story industrial building to 152 luxury apartments. The Red Hook-Gowanus Chamber of Commerce filed a lawsuit opposing the variance, saying it would touch off a conversion craze.\\n''It feels like Red Hook is being dismissed as the viable maritime and industrial community that it is,'' said Phaedra Thomas, the chamber's administrator. ''They've determined that its future is as a luxury waterfront community.''\\nUntil the 1950's and 60's, much of shipping industry in New York Harbor docked in Red Hook and South Brooklyn, where longshoremen, warehouse workers and truckers lived in the neighborhood and walked to work. Most of the jobs disappeared as the Port Authority built a modern container port on the other side of the Hudson River in Newark and Elizabeth, N.J., a move that is still seen as a profound betrayal in Brooklyn.\\nBut in the last 10 to 15 years, the Red Hook waterfront has come back to life as light manufacturers, artisans, distributors and woodworkers moved into abandoned industrial buildings and shipping resumed on some of the piers. According to a survey by the South Brooklyn Local Development Corporation, the number of businesses in Red Hook climbed to 457 in 1999, from 291 in 1991.\\nMr. Catucci said he moved 110,000 shipping containers at the Red Hook container port last year, up from 18,211 in 1994. He established the biggest port for cacao beans in the world, although it has lost ground in recent years to Camden, N.J. and Philadelphia. He said he employed roughly 750 workers, including many from the nearby Red Hook Houses, where unemployment runs as high as 30 percent.\\nThe Port Authority has complained that it spends millions of dollars a year subsidizing a barge that transports the containers from Brooklyn to New Jersey. But Mr. Catucci says he pays about $6 million of the $10 million cost of the barge and is developing plans for beverage and food distribution centers that would import goods bound for Brooklyn, Queens and Long Island, not New Jersey. He says that could eliminate the need for the barge in five years.\\nIf the city decides that in the long run the piers could be better used for housing or recreation, he said, he will gradually move his business to the largely deserted South Brooklyn Marine Terminal. But he has lost business while the Port Authority kept him in limbo over his lease -- and the city, he said, could lose hundreds of jobs, once again to New Jersey.\\n''I'm not going to stand in the way of progress, but I've got to know where I'm going,'' he said. ''We lost 400 jobs at Domino Sugar last week. I don't want to lose these jobs, too. You'll never get them back.''\\nA senior city official suggested that the loss of American Stevedoring could be offset by new jobs at a passenger ship terminal, an Ikea store and a Fairway supermarket all proposed for the area.\\nRobert Hughes, manager of the Erie Basin Bargeport, where 500 people work on barges and tugboats and at a beer distributor, said it was critical that the city retain Red Hook as its last working waterfront aside from Howland Hook in Staten Island. Tom Fox, president of New York Water Taxi, said the growth of ferries would continue only if there are places in the harbor to berth, repair and service boats.\\n''There's a mile or more of waterfront property that, depending on the whims of elected officials, might be taken out of maritime use,'' Mr. Hughes said.\\nA year ago, Carnival, the big cruise ship company, worked out a proposal with the local community board and Mr. Catucci to build a $100 million passenger terminal at Pier 7 for the Queen Mary 2 and other ships, because of overcrowding at the city's terminals on the west side of Manhattan. But the city rejected the plan. Yesterday, Kate Ascher, an economic development official, said the city would invest $250 million over the next 10 years in passenger terminals, including two berths in Red Hook, although she acknowledged that she did not know where the money would come from. In the meantime, the city offered Carnival a temporary berth at Pier 7.\\nCommunity leaders worry that if the city does not move more quickly on a permanent terminal, Carnival will follow Royal Caribbean, another cruise line, to Bayonne, N.J. ''We expected the departure of Royal Caribbean would be a wake-up call for the city,'' said Giora Israel, a Carnival vice president. ''But so far we haven't received a viable proposal.''\\nBruce Batkin, an owner of the building at 160 Imlay Street that was granted a residential variance, said he thought the city's study indicated that the waterfront was well suited for residential development, despite the lack of public transportation. Across a short stretch of water, he said, the city plans to create a resort and conference center on Governors Island.\\n''We think this should be a template for successful coexistence of commercial and residential,'' he said.\\nJeffrey Levi, chief executive of John's Gourmet, a high-end food manufacturer that employs 70 people a block away from Imlay Street, is not convinced. The people moving into expensive apartments, he said, will have concerns about truck traffic, noise, smells and Dumpsters. He pointed out how the Gillies Coffee Company in Sunset Park, another Brooklyn industrial neighborhood undergoing gentrification, was fined by the city last year after a resident complained about the smell of coffee.\\nWith the area's future so uncertain, Mr. Levi said he is considering moving to New Jersey.\\n''For me to expand, it means I would have to invest another quarter of a million dollars,'' he said.

Last year, Chris Skroupa and John Wilson sold their apartment in Hudson Heights, in northern Manhattan, and moved to Chelsea, where, as a gay couple, they already spent most of their time socializing.\\nBut they soon discovered that the neighborhood was changing faster than they expected. Home prices were rising, and many of their friends were moving to Hell's Kitchen, a few blocks west of Times Square.\\nIn restaurants that used to be almost exclusively gay, they noticed an influx of straight customers, often with children in strollers. On a recent Saturday, Mr. Skroupa and Mr. Wilson went out for brunch and ''literally less than one-third of the restaurant was gay,'' Mr. Skroupa said last week, pausing between bench presses at a New York Sports Club on Eighth Avenue.\\nFor at least a decade, Chelsea, on the West Side just north of Greenwich Village, has been the epicenter of gay male life in New York. Gay bars, novelty shops and coffee shops (notably, Big Cup, on Eighth Avenue), have drawn pilgrims from all over the country. Its reputation is such that its residents are sometimes called Chelsea Boys, and certain buildings have nicknames like the Gay Dorm or Fire Island West. But in the classic pattern of gentrification -- first come pioneers, then come families -- Chelsea is once again evolving. As mostly straight families move into Chelsea, gay residents are now gravitating toward Hell's Kitchen and beyond.\\nMr. Skroupa and Mr. Wilson said they are renting while they decide whether to set down roots. ''We didn't want to get into a situation where we were locked into a place like the Village, which has lost its edge,'' Mr. Skroupa, 44, said. The strollers, he said, were reaching a ''critical mass.''\\nIn the 2000 census, the area represented by Chelsea's central ZIP code, 10011, had the highest concentration of male same-sex households in New York, according to Gary J. Gates, a demographer, who with Jason Ost, a researcher, compiled ''The Gay and Lesbian Atlas.'' Chelsea's concentration of male same-sex households is seven times the percentage in New York overall, according to an analysis of census data by the sociology department at Queens College.\\nBut a raft of new condominium developments and rising prices in nearby neighborhoods have drawn more straight residents to Chelsea. In the past four years, developers have built or renovated about 2,000 condo and rental units, most too big for singles. With ''condos with doormen and two and three bedrooms, automatically come the families and the straight people,'' said Leonard Steinberg, a broker with Douglas Elliman in Manhattan, who is himself gay.\\nOlder buildings where gay residents represented 75 to 80 percent of the population five years ago are now at least 50-50, Mr. Steinberg said. Some buildings now have more straight residents than gay, he said.\\nWhile some gay residents may gasp at straight stroller gridlock, it should come as no surprise. Twenty years ago, when gay men and women began to leave the West Village for Chelsea, straight families moved in to take their place. Now, as Chelsea's gay incumbents disperse to Hell's Kitchen and Washington Heights as well as Fort Greene and Williamsburg in Brooklyn, they are again being replaced by straights.\\nGay pioneers ''have been trailed all the way up the West Side by straight couples with babies and Volvos,'' said Darren Sukenik, a broker with Douglas Elliman, who is gay and lives at 270 West 17th Street, a condo built in 1991. In the last six months he has sold six apartments in his building -- all to straight couples.\\nFor many gay residents the change gives rise to mixed feelings. On the one hand, the arrival of straight neighbors makes Chelsea less of a ghetto. On the other hand, a safe haven of sorts is lost. ''My friends and I talk about this all the time,'' Mr. Skroupa said. ''This is what we wanted, but in a way we're losing our little nook in the world.''\\nAlthough gay couples are also starting families, Chelsea's identity was built largely on the gay singles scene, with nightclubs and bars still drawing gay men from around the city. The appearance of spruced-up playgrounds and child-friendly restaurants has thus taken on symbolic weight.\\nPerhaps most striking was the opening of a warehouse-size Buy Buy Baby on Seventh Avenue, near 25th Street, a year and a half ago. ''It was a watershed moment,'' said Gil Neary, president of DG Neary Realty, who has sold real estate in Chelsea for 20 years.\\nWhen Abby and Rob Goldstein bought an apartment at the Chelsea Mercantile, a condominium a block from the store, Mrs. Goldstein worried that the neighborhood might not be convenient for children. ''But the day we came to do our walk-through, we saw a sign that said 'Buy Buy Baby Opening Soon,' '' said Mrs. Goldstein, whose 23-month-old son, Max, was born a month after the couple moved. ''So I said, I guess it'll be fine.'' Now, said Jamil Canal, the Mercantile's resident manager, the 352-unit building is home to 60 children, most with straight parents.\\nFor some residents, the baby boom signaled the end of an era. ''I did notice that when I started to get run over by those double-truck strollers, it was probably time to get out of Chelsea,'' Ted Davis, a 40-year-old magazine art director, said with a chuckle. He moved to Hell's Kitchen last year and this fall will pick up again, this time for Williamsburg.\\nSome lament the dilution of a supportive gay community. ''The young gay kids who are marginalized from around the country come here and then find they are priced out of the neighborhood,'' said Johnnie Tiedemann, who was shopping last week on Eighth Avenue.\\nSince 2000, the median price of an apartment in Chelsea has increased by 57 percent to $1.18 million, according to the Douglas Elliman Manhattan Market Report prepared by Jonathan Miller, an appraiser. At the same time, the average rent for a one-bedroom apartment in Chelsea is $2,477, according to CitiHabitats, the Manhattan brokerage firm, a level that prices many newcomers out of the neighborhood.\\nRichard Silvera, 23, who was sitting in Big Cup last week, said he wanted to move to Chelsea after graduating from New York University but couldn't afford it. ''Young gay people don't have the money but need the perks of a gay neighborhood the most,'' he said. ''You have just come out, you are trying to figure out who you are and who your social circle is.''\\nGranted, it's not just affluent straight buyers and renters who have driven up prices. When the Chelsea Mercantile opened in 2000, some brokers took to calling it the Gay Millionaire's Dorm because of its high sales prices. But turnover has brought in more straight buyers. Linda Gertler, a Corcoran Group agent, said that of 14 apartments she has sold in the Mercantile since 2002, 11 have gone to straight buyers.\\nFor those who have been in the neighborhood for a while, straight buyers have meant opportunities for profit. ''The gays came in and gentrified the neighborhood, and it's become a much nicer place to live,'' said Christopher Mathieson, a broker with JC DeNiro & Associates. ''And they're now cashing out and making a lot of money.''\\nSome straight families, meanwhile, say Chelsea now has a healthy fusion of lifestyles. ''Our hallway in the Mercantile is an amazing combination of young couples, gay people, families, older people, professionals and people who are at home,'' said Sophie Miodownik, who moved there three years ago with her husband, Aron, and their children, Ella and Zack, now 5 and 3.\\nGay residents who feel ambivalent about living in a gay-identified neighborhood welcome the mix, too. ''We certainly didn't pick the neighborhood as a gay cultural center,'' said David Dabill, an advertising executive who bought a two-bedroom apartment with his partner last year. Mr. Dabill said they had never even been to a gay bar in Chelsea. Straight families in the building, he said, ''are kind of a nonissue.'' If anything, he said, ''it comes in handy when you're looking for someone to look after the cats.''\\nSome newcomers hope the neighborhood won't change too much. Catherine Davis and her husband, Stephen, who are expecting their first child, fled the Upper West Side two years ago for London Terrace, a complex of rental and co-op apartments on 23rd Street. The day they moved in, Ms. Davis recalled, ''there were these two men decked out and spruced up in leather G strings on Harley-Davidsons, with huge wings, walking up 23rd Street. I was like, 'Oh, my God, I'm so glad I'm not living on the Upper West Side anymore.' ''\\nJeff Monford, a public relations executive who lives in the neighborhood, said, ''I'd like to think that mixing it up in the 'hood helps open minds and hearts and increases tolerance in general.''\\nStill, he said, communities that have undergone similar transformations, like Greenwich Village, retain their gay character long after the arrival of straight yuppies. ''The idea being that once we've been there, we leave a virtually indelible print,'' he said.\\n\", 'ONE month ago today, Richard Oceguera, 35, and Thomas Koveleskie, 33, celebrated their Massachusetts wedding of last spring with a party on the roof of their home on South First Street in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Sixty people attended this handmade ceremony, which sampled elements from early Christian services -- both men are Catholic -- blended with vows they had written themselves, followed by disco dancing to Duran Duran, Book of Love and late Blondie.\\nAs the sun set, the lights honoring the Twin Towers were lighted, along with those of the Empire State Building, and a flock of pigeons tumbled skyward from the roof of a nearby tenement (a happy coincidence). John Gillespie, a neighbor, made a toast, which he recalled the other day. \"I said that this was a transformative event both for the guests, and the building,\" Mr. Gillespie said. \"It marked a new beginning for all of us, and it felt like a blessing on the building.\"\\nThis celebration, its setting and the coincidental atmospherics -- those lights, the pigeons -- underscore Williamsburg\\'s 21st-century incarnation as a bedroom community for Manhattan professionals. The residents of 150 South First Street, the luxurious new condominium development where Mr. Oceguera and Mr. Koveleskie bought their 900-square-foot two-bedroom for $440,000 in July 2003, are prototypical of the area\\'s new citizens; many are couples looking to start a family.\\n\"We\\'ve already had a naming ceremony on the roof, for one of the two babies born in the building,\" said Mr. Gillespie, who is president of the condo board at 150 South First (his day job is medical director at Pfizer in Manhattan). \"And there\\'s another wedding planned.\"\\nNo longer a haven for artists -- or even \"artists\" -- Williamsburg feels more like Georgetown in Washington, than the East Village, to which it has been compared. At 8:45 on any given weekday morning, Bedford Avenue is a river of well-scrubbed young professionals pouring toward the L train and their city jobs across the river. (The Bedford Avenue gloss is so powerful that the developers of 150 South First Street, which is at the corner of South First and Bedford, marketed their property as 299 Bedford Avenue.) By 10 the strollers are out, careering along the same strip or parked at Fabiane\\'s Cafe.\\n\"I never thought of myself as a \\'Williamsburg kind of guy,\\' \" said Mr. Oceguera, who is director of business development at Rent-Direct.com, an online-service that connects would-be renters with landlords; he and Mr. Koveleskie had been renting together in Brooklyn Heights for four years.\\nMr. Oceguera was crisply dressed in a blinding white shirt and zippered chocolate brown Agnes B. sweater from Paris -- he and Mr. Koveleskie had just returned from a honeymoon in Italy and France -- and talking passionately about family and roots; he sees Williamsburg as fertile ground for both.\\n\"Even though this is our starter home, our first purchase,\" Mr. Koveleski said, \"we want to start a family here. We\\'ve hit all the milestones -- home ownership, marriage -- and the last one is children. Our neighbors expect it of us.\"\\nThe men say their neighbors, mostly straight couples in their 30\\'s, are sharing parenting and adoption group news. \"We all seem to have a lot in common,\" Mr. Oceguera said.\\nIt took one month for all 32 units here to sell, said Helene Luchnick, an executive vice president at Douglas Elliman who marketed the building.\\n\"At that time there was absolutely nothing else for sale in Williamsburg,\" Ms. Luchnick said. Its developers had planned the building as a rental property, until they saw the state of the market. It was Ms. Luchnick who suggested they build the rooftop deck, fitness center and kitchen. Prices are about $500 a square foot, and rising. Mr. Oceguera and Mr. Koveleskie\\'s apartment was just reappraised, they said, at about $550,000.\\nPatrice Mack, a broker at Elliman who sold the building with Ms. Luchnick, was surprised by the monolithic homogeneity of her clients. \"It was weird, we thought it would be artists or people from the area,\" she said, \"but instead it was this group from Manhattan. They even had the same stuff. Do you remember the Aerosole \\'Dollyanna\\' shoes from \\'Sex and the City?\\' \" she continued. \"All the girls were wearing those.\"\\nOld Williamsburg, the one with the Latin flavor, is still here: the vacant lot opposite Mr. Oceguera and Mr. Koveleskie\\'s living room terrace is filled with pumpkin vines. The \"artists\" are represented too: a juice bar around the corner has a street sign with the words Haight-Ashbury painted on its galvanized steel walls (there\\'s even a VW bus emblazoned with peace signs). But this couple mostly ignores such signage on their walks to emporiums like Uva\\'s Wines and Bedford Cheese down the block; both men love to cook.\\nThey met by chance six years ago in a Chelsea restaurant. A few nights later, Mr. Oceguera, new to the city from Chicago, was dialing around haphazardly for a dinner date. Mr. Koveleskie, vice president for equity and fixed income research at BBVA Securities, was the only one who answered his phone. It was 9 p.m. and he was working late. \"We\\'ve been inseparable ever since,\" Mr. Oceguera said.\\nOn May 24, Day 6 of legalized marriage in the commonwealth of Massachusetts, the men were the 350th same-sex couple to be married, they said. The state requires a three-day waiting period, but you can get a waiver, which they sought. The elderly male judge who granted it urged both to \"ignore the small-minded folks out there,\" as Mr. Oceguera remembers it. Mr. Koveleskie\\'s father told him, \"I looked up the definition of love in the dictionary, and it didn\\'t say it was only between a man and a woman.\"\\nMr. Oceguera broke in. \"Not to mention it\\'s always good for the economy when two gay guys get married,\" he said.\\n', 'Yesterday was the kind of morning when you poured water onto the Corn Flakes. No sense running to the corner bodega if you were out of milk. The TV was showing temperatures that would look right on the jerseys of quarterbacks and kickers. And there were rumblings of a storm to come.\\nAll through the windows, if you were lucky enough to have them, came fat beams of double-crossing sunshine, promising warmth that would not be delivered, not yesterday and not for a long while. It was cold out there.\\nStill, you couldn\\'t call it unexpected. It was mid-January already, late January really, and the forecasters were finally calling for the first big snowstorm of the season, one to make up for lost wintertime.\\n\"We\\'re in for, pretty much, a doozy for the weekend,\" said Michael Silva, a National Weather Service meteorologist. \"So far we\\'ve been pretty lucky, we\\'ve been pretty mild.\"\\nThe weather service was calling for a storm to cover everything over, with Arctic air masses taking advantage of a dip in the jet stream and low pressure moving across the Ohio Valley, and for snow to start falling on Saturday afternoon and to leave 12 to 15 inches on the ground, ending by Sunday afternoon. There was a blizzard warning, too, for winds stronger than 35 miles an hour to blow that snow around. The best advice, the written warning said, is \"TO STAY INDOORS.\"\\nAcross the city, people seemed to welcome that advice.\\n\"There\\'s a storm?\" asked a clerk at Reel Life, a video store in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. \"Excellent. I\\'m going to watch some football, smoke some weed and chill out.\"\\nRenee Price, a student at New York City College of Technology, who was walking down Jay Street yesterday in a hat, scarf and long coat, was making indoor plans, too.\\n\"I\\'m going to go outside and pick up the paper at 6 a.m., sneak back inside and read,\" Ms. Price said. \"The heat is already set, the mood is right and the coffee will be on at 7.\"\\nThose with work to do were less enthusiastic, but they too bowed to the storm. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority said it would suspend nearly all planned subway construction over the weekend.\\nFreshDirect, a company that delivers groceries, was making backup plans. \"If our employees can get here, we\\'re going to trudge through the snow,\" said Steve Druckman, a company spokesman.\\nAnd real estate brokers were canceling open houses.\\n\"People are saying, \\'If you have somebody to show to, call me and I\\'ll go,\"\\' said Steven Rutter, managing director of the Corcoran Group\\'s office in Park Slope. Property owners, he said, \"don\\'t want people traipsing in with snowy boots, snowy strollers, snowy kids.\"\\nThe forecasters could be wrong, but Mr. Silva seemed confident.\\n\"Most of our models are in agreement; it doesn\\'t look like they\\'re going to be wrong,\" he said.\\nYeah, but what if they are?\\n\"We could see 8 to 12 inches of snow, or we could see more.\"\\n', 'THE industrial corner of Brooklyn located about five minutes from the East Village by L train is known as a haven for Orthodox Jews and art school hipsters. In the 1990\\'s, it became home to an alternative gallery district. But over the past few years, Williamsburg, Brooklyn has also evolved into something else: a full-fledged theater district. Call it Off Off Off Broadway.\\nA decade ago, there were loft parties and shows by the fledgling Bindlestiff Family Cirkus, a neo-vaudeville troupe that now has a national following, but that was about it. Now, within this ten-block radius of nondescript warehouses, there are more than a dozen spaces devoted to theatrical work, showcasing nearly every type of theater, dance or performance. Indeed, the area is becoming so popular, that some habitu\\xc3\\xa9s are worried that they will soon be priced out. \"When I saw the bodega across the street turn into a realty office last week, I started to get nervous,\" says Michael Gardner, a co-founder of The Brick Theater.\\nPerhaps. But for now, Williamsburg is having its avant-garde moment, showing off edgy work and barely advertising it, confident that the in-the-know 20- and 30-somethings will still show up.\\nThe Charlie Pineapple Theater on North Eighth Street, with its dedicated young founders, its tiny makeshift atmosphere and multiple personalities, is an example of one type of new venue. The theater\\'s founders, Sarah and Mark VanDerBeets, are a disarmingly earnest couple devoted to dramatic revivals. Sarah, a dancer, and Mark, an actor, met at college in Santa Cruz, Calif. in the early 90\\'s and moved to New York in 2000, settling in Williamsburg after a brief stay in a Brooklyn Heights sublet and then a year or so in East Harlem. A year and a half ago, they found this building, turning one of the front rooms into a theater and the back studio into an apartment where they now live with their two-year-old son, aptly named Charlie.\\nThe 45 plush red seats were donated by a theater in Alabama, the shiny wood floors by their \"fantastic landlords\" and the name, from an enigmatic card that Ms. VanDerBeets found among her grandfather\\'s belongings, that read: \"Ask for Charlie Pineapple.\" The couple raised the money for the space using credit and savings, and they sustain it through donations and local advertisements (the program for the theater\\'s recent production of \"Of Mice and Men\" could serve as a Williamsburg Yellow Pages). Mr. VanDerBeets says of their advertising scheme: \"We\\'re pretty heavy on the sandwich board and chalk.\" Also to raise money, they sublease one of the front rooms to a lighting designer and by day offer dance and yoga classes in the theater.\\nNext month, they plan to stage Sam Shepard\\'s \"True West,\" which had an abortive run two years ago at the couple\\'s first theater, a block away. That space was shut down, midseason, for fire-code violations. (Now they point repeatedly to the new theater\\'s clearly marked exits.)\\nThe Brick, a 75-seat theater on Metropolitan Avenue, is a production by another energetic duo, Robert Honeywell and Michael Gardner. The space, which was at one time an auto-body shop, shows dance and theater as well as a monthly performance series called \"Brick-a-Brac\" featuring local performers. This summer they hosted the Hell Festival, which included original work in addition to readings of Hell-related texts like \"Faust;\" the Moral Values Festival -- listed as a performance festival for the morally questionable, morally perverse and morally bankrupt -- is on deck for next summer, inviting work from synchronized swimmers as well as playwrights.\\nWilliamsburg is also headquarters to two experimental theater groups cultivated by members of the now legendary Wooster Group: Radiohole and Collapsable Giraffe. Collapsable Hole, as the groups have named their shared space, is a spare industrial box except for all the techie gadgetry. A dazzling array of video equipment makes possible shows like Collapsable Giraffe\\'s \"Meat Is Floating By,\" in which company members acted out a nonlinear play in a camera-lined room that had been constructed onstage.\\nThe audience, seated on risers not far from the action, caught only occasional glimpses of the performers, but had constant view of them on a live video feed. At one point, the garage door leading out to the street was thrown open and the audience had to figure out that the show was over. When they wandered out to the deserted street, the actors had vanished except for a message on the sidewalk in chalk that signaled their departure. The group\\'s next show, \"Letters from Earth,\" an experimental theater piece inspired by interviews with conspiracy theorists and by Mark Twain\\'s novella \"Letters from the Earth,\" in which Satan writes to Michael and Gabriel about how strange humans are, opens in March.\\nWith no signage, the Hole is also almost impossible to find if you don\\'t know where you\\'re going. While the theater sometimes shows up in listings magazines, many other Williamsburg spaces publicize only through insider e-mail blasts from sites like Jeff Stark\\'s Nonsense NYC (www.nonsensenyc.com).\\nThe exception may be the neighborhood\\'s most successful venue, Galapagos Art Space,the Williamsburg version of P.S. 122 and its Show Nightclub rolled into one, with a reflecting pool at the entrance and fresh lilies in the restrooms. The club\\'s two stages feature musicians, films, performance art and variety shows, like the long-running Monday Night Burlesque.\\nMeanwhile, the choreographer Elizabeth Streb, who has been presenting what she calls \"action work\" in New York City since 1976 and is the recipient of a MacArthur grant, has taken up residence in a huge warehouse on North First Street. The Streb Laboratory for Action Mechanics, or SLAM, has 30-foot ceilings, from which hangs a flying trapeze.\\nSLAM is nearly always open to the public. On one recent week day, a drop-in audience member was treated to rehearsals of Ms. Streb\\'s company\\'s next show. Dancers were flinging themselves onto spring-based tumbleboards and bouncing off like rubber balls. Ms. Streb watched from a table as dancers tried running from opposite directions and throwing themselves onto the boards simultaneously without killing each other.\\nThe performance space Monkey Town will reopen in May after renovations are completed on a its fancy new space, which boasts a minimalist Japanese aesthetic. Montgomery Knott, the handsome, hatted man who runs that space, says his new theater will seat only 32 in order to give audiences that lovely feeling of being nearly alone with artists. \"Anyone who\\'s gone to a huge rock show or a giant museum exhibit knows that unless you have the perfect seat or the backstage pass or the preview ticket, your experience is colored by your level of discomfort,\" explains Mr. Knott. \"In our space, every seat is privileged by our economy of scale.\"\\nOn the other end of the size spectrum, a 7,500-square-foot club called Supreme Trading opened across from Charlie Pineapple in October with a pledge to stage all manner of entertainment, including theatrical work. And as recently as late January, the concert organizer Todd Patrick (better known as Todd P.) announced on his Web site (http://toddpnyc.com) that he is starting a new, as yet unnamed, \"DIY art/show\" space in Williamsburg.\\nSome worry that Williamsburg\\'s success as a new theatrical hot spot contains the seeds of its own demise, as the neighborhood becomes increasingly expensive.\\n\"Ultimately, and sadly, the struggle boils down to finances,\" said Marisa Beatty, the Executive Director of Williamsburg Art Nexus (or WAX), which recently closed after five years. \"I believe that the work of even the most promising creators suffers under the pressure to be the \\xc3\\xbcber-manager -- choreographer, costume designer, public relations director, dancer, producer and technical director -- of your own show. Our cost of living directly feeds this cycle by making it nearly impossible to outsource these roles.\" While Ms. Streb has eight years left on her lease, most of the others\\' leases expire in the next two or three years, by which time, many believe, certain regions of Williamsburg will have been rezoned into residential areas. That proposed change would increase the already rampant construction of condominium apartments, and the march of the MacLaren strollers.\\nTheater companies and producers in search of cheaper rents have already begun to move further and further east along the L line to Bushwick (referred to as \"East Williamsburg\" by residents in denial). It\\'s a different, less diversified scene -- more slapdash, more rock \\'n\\' roll. The two most important of these spaces are Asterisk and OfficeOps (a converted office building best known for its \"Rock \\'n Rollerskate\" parties).\\nIt\\'s probably just a matter of time before Bushwick becomes the new Williamsburg, just as Williamsburg has arguably become the new Lower East Side.\\nMs. Huggans of Collapsable Giraffe is philosophical about the her group\\'s near-inevitable exile: \"We love our space in Williamsburg,\" she says, \"but the second we can no longer find a good dive bar to drink at after rehearsal, we\\'re out of here.\"\\n', 'UNTIL recently, residents of Brooklyn\\'s Victorian Flatbush have been all dressed up with no place to go. No place in the neighborhood, that is.\\nBut that seems to be changing with the slow but steady evolution of Cortelyou Road, the seven-block-long commercial section of a street that cuts through Flatbush between Coney Island Avenue and East 17th Street. Benches and new street lamps are on the way, as 99-cent shops, bodegas and hair parlors increasingly share turf with new businesses catering to a vast ethnically diverse clientele, affluent new arrivals and young families yearning for more service.\\nEstablished businesses like the Flatbush Food Co-Op and the Greenmarket, which has expanded, have been joined by new restaurants, a cafe with a bookshop, and an antique shop, Cortelyou Vintage, which is scheduled to open Wednesday at 1118 Cortelyou Road. It will have mid-20th-century furniture and decorative accessories intending to cater to new residents coming from places like Park Slope and Williamsburg.\\n\"I\\'m looking to capture the young hipsters who want unique furniture and who are not going to go to Levitz and buy new,\" said the owner, Nicole Francis, who works as a financial planner and lives in a 10-room Victorian house nearby. \"The key market is couples with young children.\"\\nShe pays $2,000 a month, or slightly more than $2 per square foot, for a 950-square-foot retail space, with a bonus 850 square feet of garden, according to Dr. Edmund Lee, the building\\'s owner, who grew up in the neighborhood and whose Chinese immigrant parents operated a hand laundry nearby.\\nCatherine Hickey, director of economic development for the Flatbush Development Corporation, said store rents on Cortelyou Road are typically $1.50 to $3 per square foot. Vacancies are up, she said, as leases expire and landlords look for higher rents.\\nMost buildings on the street are brick, about 20 feet wide and three stories high, and were constructed around 1930, according to the Department of City Planning.\\nAsking prices for commercial properties for sale are picking up after stagnating for decades. A 4,140-square-foot building at 1502 Cortelyou Road with four residential units and a ground floor bar, the Cornerstone, is on the market for $1.3 million, according to Jan Rosenberg, a principal in Brooklyn Hearth Realty Ltd., a brokerage firm, and president of Friends of Cortelyou, the five-year-old group dedicated to improving the street. Monthly rent for the bar space is in excess of $4,000.\\nThat price is higher than most on the road, where closing prices are typically in the mid-$600,000\\'s. A three-story structure at 1410 Cortelyou Road is in contract for $650,000, according to Ms. Hickey of the Flatbush Development Corporation. The space is now a temporary headquarters for a transportation project. The buyers, Salvatore and Matteo Amato, are brothers who plan to convert it to a restaurant and bar. Their family has owned the adjacent San Remo pizzeria since 1976.\\nWilliam Del Quaglio, who paid $245,000 for the building at 1416 Cortelyou Road about seven years ago, is now in contract to sell it for $675,000. Mr. Del Quaglio used to run the bagel shop on the ground floor.\\nLike Mr. Del Quaglio, the Amato family and Mr. Lee, many property owners have long associations with the neighborhood. Sales of buildings most often take place through word of mouth and without brokers.\\nCortelyou Road is anchored at one end by the Q line subway station, an Associated supermarket and a Duane Reade, and at the other end by charmless auto body shops lining Coney Island Avenue.\\nIn between, the street has a kind of Norman Rockwell, small-town allure to it, complete with a fire company (Da Pride A Flatbush), a red-brick school, a library, rambling old colonnaded houses, a playground, massive flowering chestnut trees in full bloom and unusually wide sidewalks that invite a pleasant amble. A Mexican grocery store has pi\\xc3\\xb1atas hanging from the ceiling.\\nNamed for Jacques Cortelyou, a 17th-century tutor and surveyor who had a hand in establishing the town of New Utrecht, the street had originally been called Avenue C, according to the Brooklyn borough historian, Ron Schweiger. Around the turn of the 20th century, wealthy executives began moving into mansions on streets with lettered names and many were given upper-class British names like Argyle, Buckingham, Rugby, Marlborough and Stratford.\\nUntil 1930, a trolley ran along Cortelyou Road. Small businesses thrived until the 1960\\'s, when commerce started to slide and crime increased. Improvements were slow to germinate as new arrivals in $1 million Victorians or well-priced co-ops went elsewhere to shop and dine out.\\n\"We didn\\'t have a place where people came together and which created a sense of neighborhood,\" said Ms. Rosenberg of Friends of Cortelyou, which hopes to woo a bank and children\\'s clothing store to the area. \"And because the commercial strip was so small, I felt that only a few different stores could help create that change.\"\\nChange has gained momentum in the last 18 months. On weekend nights there are waits for a table at the popular Picket Fence restaurant, which opened a year ago at 1310 Cortelyou Road. Its bustling back garden was recently made twice as large, and now seats 50 with plenty of room for families with strollers, according to the owner and chef, Graham Meyerson, who formerly cooked at the Union Square Cafe and who lives nearby. Dishes include a pecan crusted pork chop at $15, warm garlic potato chips at $5, turkey meatloaf for $12, and a house burger for $8.\\nAbout 100 people from all over the city turned up at a recent book party at Vox Pop, 1022 Cortelyou Road, a new cafe and book shop that serves fair-trade coffees, $4 vegetable sandwiches and $6 organic turkey baguettes and whose motto is \"Books, Coffee, Democracy.\"\\nThe owner, Sander Hicks, who lives over the shop with his wife, Holley Anderson, a singer-songwriter, and newborn son, Coleman, runs a print-on-demand operation on a balcony over the bar. He was also the publisher of \"Fortunate Son,\" a biography of George W. Bush, under his own imprint, Soft Skull Press.\\nMr. Hicks got a month\\'s rent free when he opened in November, welcomed by a landlord who wanted a tenant who would help improve the street. This kind of response to the community seems typical of the new Cortelyou, he said.\\n\"Even the food co-op is now open until 11 p.m.,\" Mr. Hicks said. \"They listen to their customers.\"\\nThe street will get added exposure in the next few months when Picket Fence and Mr. Meyerson, whose wife, Chelsi, manages the seasonal greenmarket, are featured on a segment of \"Roker on the Road,\" with Al Roker, on the Food Network. According to Ms. Rosenberg, it is welcome recognition for the restaurant as well as the neighborhood.\\n\"People are finding their way here from around New York City and beyond,\" she said. \"It\\'s what we\\'ve been working for for several years.\"\\n', 'MY friend Ashton and her boyfriend, Bob, are leaving Ashton\\'s roomy, prewar apartment on West End Avenue and buying a two-story house in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.\\nThey are not making a real estate killing, the only reason I would consider budging from the Upper West Side. Like many of my fellow middle-aged Upper West Siders, I am hanging on for dear life to my bought-cheap apartment, and I\\'d hate to leave my friends, my pediatrician and my building\\'s invaluably helpful porters, the only two men I have actually considered leaving my husband for.\\nBut making money is not Ashton and Bob\\'s purpose -- which is good, since this up-and-coming neighborhood has up and come. Though the parents of young-adult children from previous marriages, Ashton and Bob are bohemians at heart. They go dancing at clubs and have small, cryptic his-and-hers tattoos on their forearms. Ashton moved to the Upper West Side from TriBeCa to be closer to her children\\'s schools, but now that her daughter is in college and her son about to go, she sees no reason to stay.\\n\"There\\'s just more street life,\" Ashton explained, though a case could be made that the street life almost anywhere is an improvement over the street life that West End Avenue has to offer, which is to say none.\\n\"We\\'re the first stop over the Williamsburg Bridge,\" Ashton said, urging me to come and see her there. My first thought was, Do I have to? Williamsburg has always sounded far, far away, and while I felt awful about it, I was already looking for excuses for not to visit her there, wherever there was.\\nGiving Brooklyn the back of your hand is a tradition in Manhattan, long predating the objections brought on by the recent exodus, objections that seem to lay the blame on too many strollers, too many hipsters, too much bragging by new residents.\\nEntrenched Manhattanites, one of the most provincial tribes on the planet, are willfully ignorant about Brooklyn. We may not be proud of the fact; I\\'m not, anyway, though I suspect some of my friends are. \"Let me say this about that,\" said my friend Ellie, who has lived for decades on the Upper East Side, when I brought up Brooklyn. \"The thought of Brooklyn has never crossed my mind and never will.\"\\nI have been to Brooklyn a couple of dozen times over the years. I have taken my children to Coney Island to see a sword swallower, which was wonderfully terrifying, and to Brighton Beach to see the spangly Russian circus on ice (leave before the skating bears, who will break your heart), and to the Brooklyn Museum and to the public library and to Prospect Park. But I have done each of these things only once.\\nOther friends have had similarly dilettantish experiences. \"I went to Paris before I went to Brooklyn,\" admitted my friend Lucy, who has lived in Manhattan for 25 years. This seemed a little extreme, until I realized that I also went to Paris before I went to Brooklyn.\\nGetting there sounds so hard to us spoiled Manhattanites, for whom nothing is that far away, by foot or public transportation. Jesus himself could come to Brooklyn and we would whine, \"I meant to go, but I don\\'t know, it just seemed really complicated.\" Nor do we trust any Brooklyn dweller\\'s blithe, easy-as-pie directions.\\nJust as every Manhattanite has a story about the fantastic apartment that got away -- the two-bedroom on Gramercy Park we could have bought for pennies in 1984 -- we all have a horror story about one spectacularly awful trip to Brooklyn, the fiasco that we can\\'t ever seem to recover from.\\nMine was the trip to the Brooklyn Children\\'s Museum with my 6-year-old daughter, along with a friend of mine and her 3- and 6-year-old children. The museum offers weekend trolley rides from Grand Army Plaza, presumably to lure those daunted by the subway-and-walking directions you get over the phone. With our retinue, it seemed easier to take a taxi to the trolley, and we found a gypsy cab willing to take all five of us.\\nThe 3-year-old threw up shortly after we crossed the Brooklyn Bridge. The owner of a Flatbush Avenue hair salon kindly let us in so we could clean up, but it took another livery cab to get us to the trolley, which by then seemed less like a treat than an annoying attempt to distract travelers from the fact that the Children\\'s Museum was somewhere near Jakarta. The cab we finally found to take us back to Manhattan broke down on the exit ramp coming off the Brooklyn Bridge. It\\'s like that feeling when you\\'re stuck in traffic on the Long Island Expressway; fair or not, you start to hate all of Long Island.\\nThe other day, to see what was happening for myself, I spent an afternoon in Williamsburg, the cool part. I ended up flashing back to my youth: I am too old to shop at anyplace called Earwax Records, and the cloying smell of incense in the Tibetan clothing shop sent me right back outside. But the place had a hopeful sweetness; my college-age daughter would love it.\\nI SPENT another afternoon with my family strolling through Brooklyn Heights, elegant and stage-set perfect, and from there to a scrappy area along Columbia Street called the Waterfront District. We ducked out of the rain into a cozy used bookstore, where we sat and read in easy chairs until the rain stopped. We bought a toile tray and fat cupcakes at a combination bakery-curios shop. We poked our heads into a dark, Dickensian furniture shop where Deco and 50\\'s pieces were selling for a song. I browsed at a dress shop owned by local designers that featured a plate of Rice Krispies treats free for the taking. We loved every minute.\\nOur guides were my nephew, Glenn, and his girlfriend, Katie. Glenn, who moved to Brooklyn Heights from the East Village last year, is not blindly in love with Brooklyn; he misses his old all-night magazine store, and says the nearest bar/restaurant is bland in menu and atmosphere with, yes, too many couples with strollers. He longs for a nearby joint that\\'s rude and loud. But he loved Brooklyn from the moment he stepped out of the subway at Clark Street to look at apartments. \"The exquisiteness was like a thunderbolt,\" he said. \"You can go from Brooklyn Heights to Cobble Hill to Carroll Gardens, and it still looks like Henry James, block after block.\"\\nBrooklyn is his slice of heaven, and I can see why, but I already have mine.\\nTHE NEW BROOKLYNS/BACKLASH Jenny Allen is a contributing editor at Good Housekeeping and a stand-up comic.\\n', 'AT a party on the Upper West Side in 2000, a distinguished American author, and longtime Manhattanite, asked where I lived.\\n\"Brooklyn,\" I told him.\\nHe snorted. \"Poor people live in Brooklyn.\" Then he turned away to get some meat.\\nShortly after the party, to see if I could move from my rented apartment in Boerum Hill, I went looking to see what I could buy in a part of Fort Greene where cars parked on the street were still regularly stolen. I told the broker that it would be nice for my kids to have a house by a park. \"We just sold a house by the park: $510,000,\" the broker said. But there was a catch. \"It had no walls or ceilings.\"\\nWhat happened, I wondered, to the distinguished author\\'s \"poor people\"?\\nSeveral years ago before, representatives of the giant warehouse shopping club Costco had approached the City Planning Department with a question: would it be worth it to open a Costco in Sunset Park, an area of Brooklyn that had lots of the aforementioned poor people? The economic data wasn\\'t encouraging. Lots of Asian immigrants lived in the area, and their median income was not high. Also, the site was half the usual size, so the Costco store would have to be built in two stories, with costly elevators and escalators.\\nBut the city\\'s statisticians advised Costco to go ahead. There was money in those undistinguished apartment houses and wood-frame houses, they said, more money than met the eye. Being an immigrant area, the neighborhood has a thriving underground economy, they said, and official housing data doesn\\'t account for illegally subdivided units.\\nThe store opened in 1996 and turned a profit in its first year. Nine years later, according to company figures, it is among the nation\\'s highest-grossing Costcos, earning upward of $150 million this year compared with $120 million for an average Costco. In fact, the store has been so successful, the chain is considering opening another giant warehouse in Brooklyn.\\nIt has become a clich\\xc3\\xa9 to say that Brooklyn is booming. But the change has become so broad -- sweeping up the yuppies of Fort Greene, the immigrant shoppers at Costco, the hipsters of Williamsburg -- that it looks for all the world like a difference not just in degree but in kind. Long seen by that distinguished author and by so many others as a poor backwater, Brooklyn now buzzes with a momentum that would have stunned residents of its sleepy streets not long ago. The change has effects salutary (a housing boom, thriving cultural life) and perilous (soaring housing costs, displacement), but the one constant is that it is huge.\\nWith 2.5 million people, the borough is bigger than San Francisco, Boston, Atlanta and St. Louis combined. The population is approaching the historic high of 1950, when Brooklyn was home to 2.74 million souls. Turn around, and you will see the renaissance. There isn\\'t a single vacant storefront along Fulton Street in Bedford-Stuyvesant, and hordes of shoppers throng Pitkin Avenue in Brownsville. After decades of disinvestment in Brooklyn, major projects are in the works, among them the development of 175 waterfront blocks, complete with 40-story luxury apartment buildings, along the Greenpoint-Williamsburg waterfront; the construction of an 800,000-square-foot sports complex for the Nets in the Atlantic Yards; and, in Red Hook, the return of cruise ships, including the Queen Mary 2 and the Queen Elizabeth 2, to a major new pier and passenger terminal.\\nAnd while housing is exploding citywide -- the number of housing permits granted citywide last year exceeded the permits granted in all of the 1990\\'s -- the two boroughs with the most housing starts in this bustling market are Queens and Brooklyn. Why so many homes? Brooklyn\\'s prime appeal is relatively low cost. Let\\'s not kid ourselves. If rents in Manhattan fell, half the hipsters in Brooklyn would rush the bridges; they\\'re a floating population. But it can\\'t be just that; otherwise Staten Island and the Bronx would also qualify.\\nPeople are also moving to Brooklyn because -- who in the 80\\'s could ever have guessed? -- it has become so much safer. From 1990 to 2000, according to the state\\'s Division of Criminal Justice Services, car theft in the borough plunged by 75 percent, robbery by 67 percent and homicide by 69 percent. In terms of mass transit, it\\'s the best-connected borough after Manhattan, with 167 of the city\\'s 468 subway stations.\\nAS for me, I live in Park Slope because I\\'m a writer. It\\'s in my union contract. Brooklyn has become the Iowa City of the East, an area chronicled and cataloged and celebrated in countless novels and poems, read and unread. The number of Brooklynites who identified themselves as \"authors and writers\" to the Census Bureau more than doubled to 3,111 in 2000 from 1,506 in 1990. By contrast, the number of \"cabinetmakers and bench carpenters\" dipped almost by half over the same period, to 334 from 602.\\nBecause of all the creative types who call the borough home, the new Brooklyn is hip. One of the clearest signs of this was a 2002 cover article in Time Out New York that ran under the headline \"Manhattan -- The New Brooklyn\" and tried hard to make the case that Manhattan was cool again. \"The Upper East Side is just a dorm,\" I overheard a young Asian hipster say to a friend as they walked amid the milling crowds on Court Street. \"I like it here. There\\'s so much life.\"\\nSometimes all of South Brooklyn feels like a giant set for a sitcom about trendy young people. On plywood barriers at a construction site on Fourth Avenue in Park Slope, I noticed a series of desperate public pleas for a change of heart by a departing roommate: \"I  3/5sheart 4/5 You Scout Please Don\\'t Leave\"; \"Scout if you stay I\\'ll be nice to you all the time. Even when I\\'m PMS\\'ing\"; \"Kate says if you stay, you can spend another night in her bed.\"\\nIt was not always thus. The unnamed young Irish hero of the Gilbert Sorrentino love story \"The Moon in Its Flight,\" set in 1948, returns to Brooklyn after a party with his sophisticated Bronx girlfriend in equally sophisticated Forest Hills. At the party, \"He skulked in his loud Brooklyn clothes,\" the novelist writes.\\n\"When he got off the train in Brooklyn an hour later, he saw his friends through the window of the all-night diner, pouring coffee into the great pit of their beer drunks. He despised them as he despised himself and the neighborhood. He fought against the thought of her so that he would not have to place her subtle finesse in these streets of vulgar hells, benedictions, and incense.\"\\nBut the new Brooklyn has more than one face. \"There are two Brooklyns,\" pointed out Arun Peter Lobo, deputy director of the population division of City Planning. \"At the very least.\" Indeed, anything you could say about Brooklyn, the fourth-largest city in America, is true somewhere within its borders. Yes, it\\'s full of hipsters; Rhode Island School of Design students hop on the bus to Williamsburg as soon as they graduate. Yes, it\\'s full of parents, marching their strollers down Union Street to shop at the organic foods co-op. Yes, it\\'s also full of immigrants.\\nAlthough Queens, the borough most thought of as the new melting pot, is home to more than a million immigrants, Brooklyn is fast catching up, with 932,000. About 38 percent of Brooklynites are foreign-born; if you include their children, their numbers jump to more than 55 percent.\\nThis isn\\'t the Jewish Brooklyn of Woody Allen or the Italian Brooklyn of \"Moonstruck.\" There are people living in Brooklyn who have no idea what stickball is, what stoop-sitting is, who the Dodgers were or why they left Brooklyn. These people play cricket in Marine Park, barbecue suckling pigs in their backyards, listen to Russian matinee idols in Brighton Beach nightclubs, and worship not Kobe Bryant and Derek Jeter but Diego Maradona, an Argentine soccer player, and Sachin Tendulkar, an Indian cricket star. They are inventing their own Brooklyn, a Brooklyn their kids will be nostalgic about 20 years from now.\\nWilly Loman, too, still lives in Brooklyn. Desperate working folks, salesmen and otherwise, struggle to provide for their families, to make the commission; attention is still not being paid. Income disparities are as big as Brooklyn itself; in 2000, the median household income in the wealthiest census tract -- in Brooklyn Heights -- was $112,414. In the poorest tract, in Coney Island, the median income, at $7,863, was not even one-tenth of that. The housing crisis exacerbates this inequality, with the world divided between those who own and those who rent.\\nAnother big division in Brooklyn is between neighborhoods close to the water, or to a park, and those away from the blue and the green. People live in the western parts of Brooklyn with their eyes fixed westward. There are people in Park Slope who can tell you where to get the best gelato in Manhattan but have no idea where to find the best roti in Brownsville. Well inland are the nonimmigrant poor, people who have been poor for a long time and aren\\'t just off the plane from somewhere else, aren\\'t hoarding hope for their children as they toil in sweatshops.\\nThe new Brooklyn has not cured poverty or solved related problems like inadequate schools. Low-quality schooling hits poor and immigrant families the most because it depletes the only substantial capital they have: their children. The children, with their great promise, are these families\\' Microsoft before Windows, their I.B.M. when it was just a typewriter company. When a public school succeeds spectacularly, like P.S. 321, in whose Park Slope district house buyers must pay a premium, parents storm the gates, with varying success. So it\\'s private school for many Brooklyn parents -- at $20,000 a year. \"It\\'s become punitive living here,\" says a writer friend who was trying to raise her kids in Park Slope. She couldn\\'t afford a house, even though her husband is a corporate lawyer. Eventually she left Brooklyn to ride horses in a mountain village in Spain, and is happier for it.\\nMOREOVER, the various redevelopment plans, grand as they are, are being fought block by block by people who will be displaced by them. The Nets arena will sit in a spot that has among the best access to mass transit in the city -- \"every train but the F,\" as my landlord proudly said when I was renting an apartment near there in 2002. Traffic, already hellish on Flatbush Avenue, may get still more hellish as several thousand fans converge at game time.\\nSo there are downsides to the new Brooklyn, but there is the boom -- and beyond all the economic data, there is a very human pull to the borough. In the world\\'s loneliest city, Brooklyn offers community. Everybody can find community in Brooklyn: the body-fluid artists in Bushwick, the Chinese restaurant workers in Sunset Park, the die-hard Marxists in the Park Slope food co-op. No matter how foreign or fringe you are, the borough has a support group for you.\\nOne reason for this is that Brooklyn is famously a series of neighborhoods. Another has to do with the physical structure of that emblem of Brooklyn -- the brownstone. Adjoining rear gardens facilitate communal interaction, gardening tips exchanged over a backyard fence. Maybe what attracts the hipsters to Brooklyn isn\\'t just cheap rents. It\\'s the closest they can get to the families they left behind, in Kansas, in Vermont, in Tokyo.\\nFor me, Brooklyn became a neighborhood one steamy August night in 2003. It was the night of the great Northeastern Blackout. In Park Slope, volunteers were out directing traffic at every intersection, even if the drivers laughed at them and zoomed past. Other Brooklynites shared phones and flashlights, or helped the elderly down dark stairwells.\\nAs night fell, the texture of the city changed. The street lamps were out, and people strolled about with flashlights and lanterns. There was a bright white moon high above the city competing with the red glory of Mars, the warrior planet, which hadn\\'t been so close to Earth in 60,000 years. The ancient Brooklyn tradition of stoop-sitting enjoyed a sudden revival.\\nAt midnight, the bars were still dispensing ice for our whiskeys. We took our drinks out on the sidewalk; we\\'d make our own laws tonight. Everyone\\'s face was illuminated in flickering, flattering light, and everybody looked beautiful and desirable. The floodlit megalopolis was transformed into a series of villages lighted by millions of small lights, in whose glow Brooklyn was revealed to be what we had forgotten it really is: an impossibly romantic, a 19th-century city.\\nTHE NEW BROOKLYNS/SIGNS OF CHANGING TIMES Suketu Mehta is the author of \"Maximum City: Bombay Lost and Found\" (Knopf).\\n', 'LIKE many New Yorkers, I groaned when the Kmart went up in Astor Place in 1996. Although I\\'ve been known to celebrate Target\\'s underwear supply, and I bought my fax machine at Best Buy, I find nothing more overwhelming than browsing in a big-box store, with its booming pop music, jaundiced fluorescent lights and mind-numbingly endless aisles of products.\\nSo I have been surprised to find myself among the many New Yorkers converging on the Container Store, at 19th Street and the Avenue of the Americas in Chelsea, not just for the shopping, but for its restorative effect. At the Container Store\\'s 25,000-square-foot beachhead, devotees wander past the 70-foot-long wall of coat hangers in shades of peach and lime, past honeycombs of diamond-shaped sock organizers and Lucite shoeboxes in every color of the rainbow, suffused with a feeling of tranquillity.\\nThe Container Store is dedicated to the proposition that there is a place for everything sprawling and untidy, and that that place is probably made of Lucite and probably stackable. It has become such a familiar part of the shopping landscape that many of us can no longer remember where we bought coat hangers and milk crates before the store opened.\\nEven those who secretly wonder just how many filing cabinets and in-boxes one person can possibly buy have been known to embrace this particular place. As if in a trance, they dreamily push their overflowing carts and smile as beatifically as Stepford wives as they make their way down aisles wide enough to accommodate the twin strollers that have become the hallmark of latter-life procreators. Track lights shine their heavenly beams on the portable canvas closets, the stacking totes, the Tupperware and the galvanized metal storage cubes, all in soothing earth tones of khaki and moss and pewter.\\n\"It\\'s all possibilities in there,\" explained Raina Moore, a 34-year-old children\\'s book editor who lives in a 425-square-foot apartment in South Williamsburg, Brooklyn, and has a particular fondness for closet organizing supplies. She often makes weekly trips to the Container Store, whether or not she needs a new rattan gift box.\\nThe place gives Ms. Moore the illusion of power, tantalizingly holding out the idea that the chaos of her life, not to mention the clutter found in the typical 500-square-foot apartment, can be brought under control. \"Everything in there is a solution,\" Ms. Moore said. \"As soon as you walk in, you just feel like your problems are solvable.\"\\nThere are thousands of tiny projects that can be finished with just a little help from these storage gurus. The moment I put the cat food in the purple plastic bucket with the spinning lid, I have achieved my goal. I\\'m relaxed just thinking about it.\\nSome Container Store disciples don\\'t even actually buy the stuff. So soothing is the place, they simply roam among its smorgasbord of items, fantasizing about the perfect compartmentalized closet, the perfectly organized spice rack.\\n\"You walk in, and you just feel this immediate sense of calm,\" says Cris Beam, a 33-year-old writer and avid Container Store browser, who lives in a 500-square foot apartment with her partner in Morningside Heights. During times of high stress, Ms. Beam has been known to frequent the Container Store several times a week; for her, even wandering the aisles empty-handed is enough to melt away the anxiety.\\nOf course, there\\'s something else going on. We New Yorkers, with our shoebox-sized apartments, our lack of garages and basements and attics, are the perfect audience for this particular chain store.\\nWhile organizational products have been available for years at Container Store competitors like Hold Everything, that store is relatively small, and caters largely to a more upscale clientele. Bed, Bath & Beyond is the opposite: filled with clutter that only compounds a sense of imminent chaos. \"You go into Bed, Bath & Beyond,\" Ms. Moore said, \"and you\\'re already having to move things around to fit that new thing that you\\'re buying.\"\\nThe Container Store, by contrast, follows a very calculated strategy. It offers just the right number of options -- enough to appeal to a variety of social classes (coat hangers range from 29 cents for the classic plastic tubular hanger to $19.99 for a cedar suit hanger), but not so many that you feel as if you\\'ve stepped into a vertical flea market. The chain has also made a conscious decision not to diversify: You won\\'t find hand lotion and gum at the cash register.\\nThe Container Store, which began in 1978 with a single outpost in Texas selling industrial storage products that had previously been available only wholesale, now has 34 outlets. The New York store, though only 18 months old, is the chain\\'s most profitable; it did $24 million worth of business last year ($9 million in shelving alone), which is three times as much as the average Container Store.\\nFull-time employees -- a group that includes everyone from college students and grandparents to aspiring actors and disillusioned lawyers -- undergo 241 hours of training in their first year, and learn to ask all sorts of probing questions about your problems so they can use the cross-training that has been drilled into them. Yes, that garbage bin could double as a laundry basket. That laundry basket could work as a dog bed. The Lucite storage bins can be used for holding winter clothes or seasoning a turkey (and customers have bought them for both purposes).\\nOne customer came in search of a way to divide her mother\\'s ashes among three sisters (a clerk presented her with four small tin paint cans and four silk-covered gift boxes in which to put them). Another woman needed a box in which she could lock up her food; she was afraid that her boyfriend was going to poison her. Even in issues truly involving life and death, the Container Store can offer at least a temporary solution.\\nURBAN TACTICS Lisa Selin Davis\\'s first novel, \"Belly,\" will be published this month by Little Brown.\\n', 'In some parts of New York, the word stroller elicits images of Bugaboo behemoths and others like them that are popular in parent-heavy neighborhoods. But on Wednesday, more than 1,500 strollers are expected to gather on Staten Island, and there will not be an infant in sight.\\nIn this case, the strollers are people over 65 who will be celebrating having walked miles and miles this summer as part of a city program to promote exercise and healthy habits among New York\\'s older population.\\nThe \"Senior Stroll,\" sponsored by the New York City Department for the Aging, will bring together 140 walking clubs from throughout the city for a mile-long stroll through Fort Wadsworth. The clubs, which come together at centers for the aging, churches and nursing homes, provide opportunities not only for a bit of a workout, but also for social interaction.\\nWith nearly one out of every five New Yorkers now over age 60, according to the department, the agency has been seeking low-cost ways to keep older residents in shape. Having encouraged the creation of walking clubs in the past, officials decided to up the ante this year and add a contest to see how far club members could collectively walk from April through August.\\nHarriet Stollman, director of the department\\'s health promotion division, calculated the number of steps necessary to cross the boroughs, with 2,000 steps equaling about a mile, and distributed pedometers to clubs. They selected their own walking path, be it on a city street, at a nearby park, or indoors to keep cool. \"Seniors want to take care of themselves and maintain their health,\" Ms. Stollman said. \"They recognize the importance of physical activity, and are willing to get out there and be as active as possible, even if they\\'re using a cane or walker.\"\\nSome groups have amassed an impressive number of steps. The one at the United Hindu Cultural Council Senior Center in South Ozone Park, Queens, has recorded more than 4.6 million steps, the highest in Queens, and an amount that Ms. Stollman says is equal to crossing the borough one way more than 180 times. At the Senior Stroll, the team with the most miles from each borough will be recognized for its effort with a certificate and a plaque.\\n\"My philosophy is that everybody should be happy and healthy,\" said Chan Jamoona, the director of the United Hindu center, as she clipped a pedometer to the waistline of Sookia Ramshoi\\'s Marshmallow Peep-yellow dress. Ms. Jamoona, who is also a nurse, ushered Ms. Ramshoi, 74, and the other 80 members of the center\\'s walking club outside, and with an authority that was half drill sergeant, half kindergarten line leader, led the walkers down Rockaway Boulevard. Walking two by two, the walkers stretched back nearly a block, laughing and singing as their neighbors waved hello.\\nThe group, most of whose members are in their 70\\'s, takes to the streets three or four times a week, usually for a few blocks. \"I have a bad knee, but since I\\'ve been coming here, I feel much better,\" said Phulbas Swebans, 75. Ms. Swebans has diabetes, but she said the walking sessions had lessened her need for blood sugar medication and lowered her blood pressure. She now takes yoga classes at the center and has been trained as an instructor. \"It\\'s for my own health and benefit,\" she said. \"You have to look after No. 1.\"\\nAnother regular walker, Jennet Khan, 71, agreed. \"When you go in for a check-up, your doctor doesn\\'t believe your age,\" she said. \"He asks for your birth certificate.\"\\nSome clubs, like the one at the Diana Jones Senior Center in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, are using the strolls to explore their neighborhoods and share their own history tours.\\n\"They see the changes in the neighborhood and all the new development,\" said Narcisa Ruiz, the program director at the Jones center. \"As we go by Broadway and Kent Avenue, or by Peter Luger\\'s, for example, they remind each other how it used to be when they were younger, and start telling you stories.\"\\nThe relationships formed within the walking groups can be just as important as the physical benefits, Ms. Stollman said.\\n\"A lot of seniors don\\'t like walking alone; they\\'re afraid,\" she said. \"But now they look out for each other. They walk with friends, enjoy the outdoors, and participate in something that keeps them young.\"\\n', '', 'BACK in 1998, Bedford Avenue had no cheery muffin store. The main drag of Williamsburg, Brooklyn, was, however, home to a growing number of galleries, plenty of illegal residential lofts and an incipient chorus of complaints over the nighttime din outside musty local bars. The dream of an edgy Williamsburg was young and alive. And when a young couple started a small wholesale bag-making business on Bedford Avenue, the effort seemed perfectly in step with broader trends in the area.\\nOn Thursday night, the business, known as Brooklyn Industries, reached a milestone of sorts. At its store on Bedford Avenue at North Eighth Street, devotees of Brooklyn Industries gathered for a retrospective to honor its artistic vision, which is now in display at six retail locations and on a thriving Web site. The Williamsburg to be seen outside the flagship store has changed; it is characterized by strollers, people in business attire and little dogs on leashes. But at least at this event, the same doses of hair dye and irony that made the area famous in recent years were in full view.\\n\"Now it\\'s a party,\" said a young woman, her short hair bleached three-fourths white and one-fourth a very strident brown, as the beat of a laconic reggae song grew louder. Along the store\\'s north wall there stood a giant display depicting a timeline of Brooklyn Industries\\' T-shirt designs through the ages.\\n\"It\\'s urban culture, sort of street wear in general,\" said Paul Cochran, a 25-year-old designer who knew of the store\\'s reputation even before he moved to Brooklyn from Cincinnati last year. Once in town, Mr. Cochran hastened to view in person the store\\'s endless assortment of bags, jeans, jackets, skirts and especially T-shirts -- everywhere T-shirts.\\nAs the party swelled, young men and women wearing serious expressions and winter hats and scarves nibbled cheese and cookies; others in dreadlocks and faux-hawks sipped white wine from plastic cups. Young children, a newer addition to the neighborhood, jumped onto camouflage-colored chairs and huddled over a Game Boy.\\nThe shirts on display, a sort of greatest-hits collection, included messages both local (\"Save the G Train,\" \"The Kings County\"); Spanish (\"Revolt Brooklyn!\"); and international (\"Cuba Libre,\" featuring an image of Castro in a threatening pose). Some newer designs were more abstract in message; one from last year depicted a tranquil-looking woman sitting on the back of a grimacing man, both of them clothed.\\nThe store\\'s co-founders, Lexy Funk and Vahap Avsar, circulated through the crowd, chatting with customers, designers and employees as the band Death From Above 1979 blared from the stereo.\\nWhen the couple first met in the late 1990\\'s at an artists\\' residence program upstate, it is unlikely that they imagined they would become the grande dame and grand homme of Williamsburg couture.\\n\"Vahap found a billboard in a Dumpster one night,\" Ms. Funk said, explaining how the business began. \"We brought it to our studio, and decided to make a billboard bag out of it. We went to the first trade show we could find and started selling them.\"\\nAt the time, the couple were living in Manhattan, but they soon occupied a factory at North 15th Street and Wythe Avenue in Williamsburg\\'s north end, and under the label Crypto started making more bags -- out of used FedEx boxes, pieces of felt, anything they could find. Some bags fell apart, but people liked them, and soon the couple were producing T-shirts with a Brooklyn Industries logo.\\nAt the time, the scene on Bedford Avenue was in its infancy. \"It was a few little cafes and a few clothing stores,\" said Matt Wood, who designed many of the T-shirts to be seen at the party. \"Now I come back here, and there\\'s stuff everywhere.\"\\nIn those spare first months and years, Mr. Avsar and Ms. Funk lived above the factory, and sold items only wholesale. But they soon decided to open their own shop in 2000, in a 300-square-foot space on Bedford Avenue. Sales grew, and after the Sept. 11 attacks, the couple decided to end their wholesale business and focus only on retailing Brooklyn Industries goods. A mini-empire was born.\\nAS the party continued, longtime customers reflected on how their neighborhood has evolved.\\n\"It\\'s turning into a mini-Village,\" complained Tatiana Ardila, 20, who grew up in Williamsburg and works at Starbucks. Her companion, Michal Dulski, also 20 and a graphic designer, looked around at the shop and remembered its past.\\n\"Originally when this store started, it was pretty plain,\" said Mr. Dulski, who was wearing a gray ski jacket, a Brooklyn Industries computer bag and a sheen of stubble. While the pressed-tin walls used to be lined with a minimalist display of shirts and bags, the racks and shelves now burst forth with an array of garments in understated yellows, browns and greens. The neighborhood, too, has expanded, so much so, Mr. Dulski predicted, that on the next shirt \"they\\'ll probably have to put in a couple of high-rises.\"\\nYet some of the T-shirts pay homage to the Williamsburg that is not new. Leonora Russo, known by many as the mayor of Williamsburg, is shown on a white T-shirt in two photos: one of her as a 19-year-old model, the other of her many decades later. Her 19-year-old self paid $25 a month in rent and was the object of so much attention on the street that she caused car crashes on Bedford Avenue.\\n\"That\\'s when the streets went both ways,\" said Ms. Russo, who this evening was wearing a brown fur coat, a sequined beret and the same tinted windshield glasses she wears on her T-shirt. She had been a shopper at the store when Mr. Wood, the designer, decided to immortalize her in cotton. Now she sees her own face -- her faces, really -- everywhere.\\nAt the party, in between telling old stories, Ms. Russo took customers by the hand over to the display and pointed to the shirt with her cane, all pride and radiance. \"You gotta buy one and sleep in it,\" she said, possibly winking. \"Pretend I\\'m in your arms.\"\\n', 'On a rainy winter afternoon, just a few minutes after running over a stray hubcap, just after having to pull his beat-up Toyota sedan off a beat-up section of the beat-up Brooklyn-Queens Expressway and having to run the little white car back and forth until at last the hubcap broke free, Tom Le, choreographer-turned-real-estate-agent, re-enters the mad rush of the highway and a mile or so later exits as planned, ending up on a detour, Park Avenue. \"I\\'m running a little late,\" he says, semicalmly, into his cellphone.\\nThis Park Avenue, by the way, is no Park Avenue. This Park Avenue runs through the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn, passing soot-covered stores, forgotten (for the moment, anyway) tenements, forlorn housing projects, factories that may or may not be empty, auto-repair shops and Hasidic women pushing strollers. This is the Park Avenue that -- as the sky now begins to pour, as the broken-up streets flood with oil-slicked water -- lands Tom Le, a Corcoran Group Realtor, at the intersection of Central and Evergreen, in a vista of plumbing-supply stores and fenced-in yards that is neither central nor green.\\nThen he parks, locks, dashes into an old storefront, so that he is suddenly the tiniest bit overdressed, a tinge too businesslike for the all-of-the-sudden hip environs. Brushing off his navy blue blazer and straightening his rain-soaked red tie, he orders a carrot-ginger soup, and a high-energy smile breaks across his face like a banner unfurling. With an accent that is part Californian, part Vietnamese, part top-selling real-estate agent, he asks rhetorically, \"Isn\\'t this great?\"\\nBy this he means Bushwick, the next new neighborhood or, more precisely, a neighborhood that is now in the sights of New York City real-estate agents and developers as the next new neighborhood. This is Bushwick as seen from the banquette at Life Caf\\xc3\\xa9 Nine 83, a cool place with mostly comfort food (meatloaf, fried chicken) and a few vegan options. There is also a new late-night menu, now that people in the neighborhood have started staying in the neighborhood on Saturday nights.\\nBefore the late-night menu, they went to the Lower East Side, for instance, where the first Life Caf\\xc3\\xa9 opened, back when that was the next neighborhood, in the 80\\'s. Or they went to Williamsburg (the next neighborhood of the mid-90\\'s), which, of course, they still do, Williamsburg only being a couple of stops away on the L train. The point is that an early stage of next-neighborhood development happens when the people who have most recently moved in begin to recreate there the place that they either wanted to be in originally or that rent increases moved them out of. It\\'s sometimes tough to distinguish, especially now when the next-neighborhood cycles seem to be picking up speed, when people are beginning to be kicked out of neighborhoods their demographic equals haven\\'t even heard about yet.\\nThough people are now hearing about Bushwick. \"The neighborhood\\'s definitely, as they call it, up and coming,\" says Roody Hyacinthe, an agent with Fillmore Real Estate who sells in Brooklyn. \"I remember two or three years ago, when houses were coming on the market, we were giving them away.\" They\\'re not giving them away anymore.\\n\"You will see,\" says Le.\\nNaturally for Tom Le, as for real-estate agents and real-estate buyers and renters everywhere, Bushwick\\'s hotness is, first of all, about location. And in New York, location starts out as having to do with subway lines -- in this case the L train. The L train is connected to Manhattan, the island from which even next neighborhoods still ultimately derive their nextness, but in the case of Bushwick, the L train is the train that connects it to past next neighborhoods -- i.e., the Lower East Side and Williamsburg. (Until very, very recently, parts of Bushwick were referred to in real-estate listings as \"East Williamsburg,\" sometimes when it is East Williamsburg, sometimes when it isn\\'t really because it\\'s really Bushwick.)\\nBushwick is roughly the shape of Vermont. Williamsburg is its neighbor to the north. On its west is Bed-Stuy, a neighborhood that, given the rising prices in Clinton Hill, the adjacent neighborhood heading farther west, toward Manhattan, is also something of a next neighborhood. (See also the Port Morris and Mott Haven neighborhoods in the Bronx.) On Bushwick\\'s eastern border is Ridgewood, in Queens -- Ridgewood, in turn, being bordered by vast plots of parklike green that, at the moment, are zoned only for the dead.\\nAfter location in the real-estate hotness calculus comes price, and in Bushwick the price is right -- i.e., low, or pretty low, as far as New York goes. Rents, which are rising, are around $1,400 for 1,200 square feet, at the moment -- about half what they are in Dumbo, which was a next neighborhood six or seven years ago, and perhaps at a third of what they are on the Lower East Side. Likewise, a half-million dollars won\\'t get your phone call returned by real-estate agents in Manhattan, where the average apartment now sells for more than a million. But in Bushwick, half a million dollars can still get you a small single-family home (or could have before this article appeared). As Le says, continuing his lunch-table neighborhood tour, \"This hasn\\'t yet been discovered.\" And by this he still means Bushwick.\\nAs with exploration in the Renaissance, discovered in New York real estate is a problematic concept. The old building directly across the street from Life Caf\\xc3\\xa9 is owned by the Baierlein family, whose ancestors have been there since around the time Mayor McClellan was elected mayor in 1903, since the first subways opened, since the Williamsburg Bridge was built and since O. Henry wrote his New York stories. The Baierleins are a remnant of the German population that came to the little village of Bushwick in the mid-1800\\'s, the immigrant group that built the breweries of Brooklyn. In the 1920\\'s, after the Germans discovered Bushwick, it was discovered by Italians. After World War II, when the Italians moved to the suburbs, Bushwick was discovered by Puerto Ricans. During the city\\'s fiscal crisis, the last German breweries closed, and then riots during the blackout of 1977 nearly destroyed the neighborhood completely; by then, the Baierleins had boarded up their apartments to protect them from the fires that were raging through what was becoming a neighborhood of abandoned lots. Bushwick was discovered yet again in the 1980\\'s by new New Yorkers from the Dominican Republic, as well as Guyana, Ecuador, Jamaica, India and China, new immigrants who moved to Bushwick not for cool restaurants but to survive in what was a civic wasteland. Most recently, in the 10 years before the opening of the Life Caf\\xc3\\xa9 in 2002, Bushwick was discovered by people moving to New York from Mexico. Bushwick is a Dutch word sometimes translated as \"refuge.\"\\nLe\\'s discovery of Bushwick started when his own friends -- dancers and artists -- moved into lofts in the area in the 90\\'s, lofts with no heat or water or plumbing; they used charcoal barbecues to keep warm. It was then that Le was making the transition from dance to real estate, the business of his family in California. He started with Fillmore Real Estate and became a \"top producer,\" to use the industry term. \"I told them to open an office in Williamsburg,\" he goes on. \"So when we did, people started coming into the office looking for places. They\\'d say my budget, for example, is $500,000. Sadly, with half a million they can\\'t afford Williamsburg or East Williamsburg.\" And there, by East Williamsburg, he means East Williamsburg. That\\'s when he mentions the discovery: Bushwick. Real estate is so often the business of readjusting dreams.\\nTake the couple that showed up not long ago at his office. \"We were looking for Williamsburg,\" Le says, speaking real-estate-ese, a first-person plural. \"We had $700,000 to spend. One is a sculptor; the other one is also an artist, does installation. And they said, \\'We\\'d love something we could have our studio in,\\' and I said: \\'Well, 700 is a lot of money. We can get you a two-family. But for a studio, if you want bigger space, you may have to go farther out.\\' And they said: \\'Fine. What do you think you have?\\' At that time, I had a four-family and a store, plus a warehouse in the back. This is just about a year ago. In the back is a huge warehouse with a 20-foot ceiling. They went there, and their mouths -- they just went like: \\'Oh, my God! This is great!\\' And they got it for $650,000! It\\'s off of Central.\"\\nThe final factor in next-neighborhood hotness has to do with the presence of what might be broadly categorized as artists. In forest succession, leafy hardwoods like alder precede the towering softwoods like pine, and in real estate in New York, it is the artists who arrive first in a neighborhood that is about to change, especially in industrial sites, especially in large old spaces abandoned and left for dead. \"This is the story of real estate,\" Le says, \"that the artists are always pioneering.\" It is the story of SoHo, West Chelsea, Williamsburg. In this case, the first artists arrived in Bushwick in the 90\\'s, when Bushwick\\'s factory areas were still burning.\\n\"When I moved in 1991, there was a crack-for-sex trade on my landing,\" says John Jasperse. Now Jasperse is a nationally recognized choreographer who until recently kept his studio for his dance company in Bushwick; then, he was a not yet nationally recognized young choreographer who, with three other artists, persuaded a landlord to let them renovate an abandoned loft building. \"Basically the reason we were there was because nobody wanted to be there,\" he says.\\n\"It was a war zone,\" says Rob Herschenfeld, a furniture designer, who in 1996 was feeling pushed out of a rented space in Williamsburg. He bought a loft building on Boerum Street, a place that real-estate agents called East Williamsburg a few months ago (and may even be East Williamsburg) but is now called Bushwick. He did not seek out cafes at the time, not that there were any. \"We were too busy emptying out the crack addicts,\" he says.\\nTorben Giehler, a painter, showed up at the end of the 90\\'s, renting a space in Herschenfeld\\'s building; Herschenfeld\\'s mother and building manager, Phyllis, approved a lease when few other people would. \"I couldn\\'t get any credit, and Phyllis, she just liked my work and gave me the place,\" he says. He had a view of feral dogs, prostitutes and a guy who shot up heroin while driving and, as a result, ran into a couple of cars.\\nGiehler\\'s friend Jeffrey Reed, a sculptor and photographer, was there a year or two later in 2,000 square feet of raw space on the side of a construction yard, which he got for $1,200 a month. He found the streets nerve-racking. \"If you saw someone, you would start walking the other way,\" he says. \"You just assumed there wasn\\'t any reason that anyone would be there.\" When Reed visited Giehler\\'s space at the end of the day, they would look out the window at the view of burning cars. Once, as a long stream of gasoline made its way down the street, they suddenly realized that Reed\\'s car was about to catch fire, but they managed to run down and move it in time.\\nAfter artists came students, also as per the next-neighborhood cycle -- students like Cynthia Rojas, who moved in 2001, arriving from California, with her husband, Brian Lease, a classically trained vibraphone player who plays in a band called Fisherman\\'s Xylophonic Burlesque Orchestra. For recreation, they went to the Laundromat on Flushing Avenue. \"That was it,\" she says. \"It was like camping.\"\\nThe development of cool places kicked off in 2002, after Kathy Kirkpatrick, who founded the original Life Caf\\xc3\\xa9 in the 80\\'s, moved to Bushwick, taking the first apartment she saw for rent. \"Then I looked out my window,\" she says, \"and I kept seeing hipsters. And then I thought, This looks just like the people who were living in the East Village.\" In August 2002, she opened up a restaurant, small, with just a steam table, as well as newspapers and essentials, like onions and toilet paper. \"I didn\\'t realize the desperate desire of the community here to have a place -- the musicians and artists and the writers who needed to get out and hang,\" she says.\\nA few months later, Kevin Lindamood, who had come to Bushwick a few years earlier from western Virginia, renovated an industrial building and opened a nonprofit arts-oriented space called OfficeOps. There\\'s a movie screening room and a big kitchen for parties, as well as a new thrift shop. Sometimes Lindamood rents out the roof for weddings and other events. Sometimes those events are even attended by Williamsburgers.\\nAt the end of 2002, Herschenfeld built a small grocery store, Brooklyn\\'s Natural, right near the Morgan Avenue L stop exit on Bogart Street, and one of the people working with him opened a bar around the corner, called Kings County. (Today, a rock-climbing wall decorates the spire of Herschenfeld\\'s remodeled warehouse.)\\nSince Life Caf\\xc3\\xa9 and Brooklyn\\'s Natural opened, all kinds of artists and performers have come to make Bushwick home. In 2003, Jonah Bokaer, a dancer with Merce Cunningham, started Chez Bushwick, a salon for artists and performers in Herschenfeld\\'s loft building on Boerum. \"It\\'s a very catalytic place,\" Bokaer says.\\nFor his part, L.D. Beghtol says a kind of artistic critical mass may have been reached that year. Beghtol had been living in the Baierlein family\\'s apartments since 2000, moving there after five years in downtown Manhattan. A Village Voice art director, he is also a member of several bands and band collectives, like L.D. & the New Criticism, and sang on the Magnetic Fields\\' three-CD song cycle, \"69 Love Songs.\" One night in 2002, Beghtol was in Life Caf\\xc3\\xa9, having a drink, when a D.J. played the song \"Lions\" by Tones on Tail, what might be called a next-next-neighborhood band. \"I thought, I can\\'t believe I\\'m hearing this in my neighborhood bar,\" Beghtol said. The D.J. turned out to be the girlfriend of Jim Bentley, who had just moved to Bushwick from Chicago (seeing a likeness to the Ukranian Village in Chicago, where all the musicians hang out). Bentley runs the Fort, a neighborhood recording studio, and now labels the projects he produces with Beghtol and others with the stamp \"Made in Bushwick.\" \"There\\'s a lot going on here that hasn\\'t hit the airwaves, but it will,\" Beghtol says.\\nNext-neighborhood development has now reached a pivotal juncture in Bushwick. The area still won\\'t be mistaken for the Upper West Side or even Williamsburg. There is no giant luxury supermarket; there are no dry cleaners in the warehouse district, and not many anyplace else. Crime is still bad, or really bad (the rates of violent crime are still among the highest in the city) -- last year, the local precinct reported 15 murders, 40 rapes, 467 robberies and 399 felonious assaults. And while there may not be as many cars burning in the warehouse district as there used to be, the streets still feel desolate.\\nBut Bushwick is now definitely in the next stage. In May 2004, the neighborhood got its first video store-cafe, the Archive. Northeast Kingdom, the latest artist-affiliated restaurant, opened in October 2005, started by two Vermont natives currently living in Williamsburg proper. In the past year, luxury condos started showing up for $400,000. And there is even a festival -- a festival that uses an acronym, acronyms seeming to be the linchpin of the real-estate business. Late last summer, Ruth Garon, who coordinates arts events, arrived in Bushwick for the very first time, after moving from Tel Aviv to Manhattan. \"I was having a crisis with New York,\" she says. \"And it was the first time I felt a sort of community.\" Four months later, she was inspired to organize the Bushwick Art Project, or BAP, a neighborhood happening of video V.J.\\'s and D.J.\\'s and film and dance and live music. Each time Garon held a meeting in her Cook Street loft, she noticed that more and more artists came. She also noticed that local residents began to resist an art festival. \"Some people were suspicious, and they said the people from Manhattan will come and everything will be expensive,\" she recalls. \"But after a while, they saw that we were working from a pure place.\"\\nPerhaps those most affected by a neighborhood\\'s nextness are the people who are already living there, the people who have been living there for years and are not necessarily looking for a place to install a video-dance piece but are trying to live, maybe even raise children. In this case, these are the people living in what a real-estate agent might at this moment be calling Deep Bushwick, that place with tired but well-swept row houses along Knickerbocker Avenue or in and around Wyckoff Avenue, another old commercial strip. If you follow Tom Le as he tours around Bushwick in his car, he will stop you on a street of two-family row houses and get out and point around and say how great they are, as investment opportunities. \"One of the most wonderful things about Bushwick is that it is a wonderful established family neighborhood,\" he says. \"You can drive up and down the streets in Bushwick and you see families out there.\"\\nThis neighborhood of families survives on some of the lowest incomes in the city; Bushwick\\'s median household income is about $22,000. One-fifth of the neighborhood is on public assistance. Bushwick also has foreclosure rates four times higher than the city average. Meanwhile, almost 40 percent of the neighborhood pay more than 60 percent of their incomes on housing, according to a report by the Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy at New York University. A neighborhood survey found that 69 percent live with cockroaches, 47 percent with rats or mice, 30 percent with mold; the rate of hospital visits for asthma is four times the city average. Sometimes -- for people who are not on public assistance and live in a city where the highest-earning families have nine times the income of the lowest -- the rising rents are pushing tenants to buy homes they can\\'t afford.\\nAngel Vera has lived in Bushwick for 14 years. Originally from Ecuador, he is an organizer with a community group called Make the Road by Walking, on Grove Street, near the intersection of Myrtle and Broadway -- an area that was nearly destroyed during the rioting and looting of the citywide blackout in 1977. Last year, Make the Road organized the workers at discount-sneaker and apparel stores to get them the minimum wage and benefits. Still, the neighborhood feels on the verge: a little Latin American music store is closed, and the local credit union almost got priced out of an affordable office. Construction workers carry new Sheetrock into recently emptied apartments. \"There are a lot of landlords who are evicting whole buildings lately,\" Vera says. \"People move here because somewhere else is more expensive. That\\'s the system. This automatically puts low-income people in danger.\"\\nBut it\\'s not just the low-income people. Maybe it\\'s because the next-neighborhood cycle turns so quickly now or maybe it was always the case, but in the Bushwick that is about to happen, artists are already being kicked out, before more than even a handful of new home buyers get to live alongside them. \"It begs the question, Is New York just going to consume itself?\" says John Jasperse, who was kicked out of his loft space last year when his landlord began to convert his studio space into condos. \"Because the identity of it as a place of cultural expression seems less and less possible. I\\'ve really seen the ecology of the place change. And, yes, it\\'s safer and it\\'s cleaner, and, yeah, there are some individual artists who are really fighting the fight. But they\\'re also getting slammed, and you can\\'t expect that the fight is going to constantly repeat itself. It\\'s going to take some kind of responsible developer or some action by the government, because we can\\'t just be making money, money, money. If it\\'s just left to market economics, then everywhere is just going to be brokers on Wall Street.\"\\nBack at lunch, Tom Le works to keep things positive. \"There\\'s that horrible word, gentrification, but it\\'s not all bad,\" he says. And he talks about his own plan to assuage the harshness of the market, which is mostly a plan for assuaging the hardships on artists. He dreams of helping artists invest in real estate, of opening an artists\\' studio in Bushwick himself, with an upstate affiliate perhaps. He speaks of the trends in terms of unstoppable natural forces. \"The machine keeps going,\" he says, \"and it\\'s not the developers, it\\'s not the Realtors. It\\'s the demand that keeps the machine going, and you have to invest so that you are ready when the next transformation occurs. We can ride the wave or get kicked out.\"\\nBut mostly Le talks about how things are really happening in the neighborhood, pricewise. On the weekend, he will run an ad: \"Vacant 6-family in Bushwick, brownstone 26 x 70, 1 block from train and shopping in the next hot neighborhood, ideal development or condo conversion. $849K.\"\\n\"Three or six people can come in there, renovate it and have a wonderful community there,\" he says. \"It\\'s on Bushwick, right off Broadway, which is great.\"\\nEven in the past few weeks, housing prices in the neighborhood have increased. Buildings are even flipping. Le sold a building on Chauncey Street, off beat-up Bushwick Avenue, for $500,000, which the owner bought for just over $300,000 a year or so ago. And then there are the condo conversions -- a 16-unit condo conversion off Central Avenue, a few subway stops from Williamsburg and just a few minutes from Manhattan, with private parking and outdoor space at $400 a square foot -- a real deal, even if prospective buyers might be a little nervous when they first see it, at least until they see the video store and the place to buy organic yogurt.\\nAfter he finished his soup, Le set off to see a client. But he e-mailed later to check in, because since he left dance, real estate is, as he says, \"my life seven days a week.\"\\n\"As you can see, Bushwick is very dynamic,\" he wrote. \"Should you need any more assistance or you are ever in need to chat about exciting new neighborhoods or to discuss new places to hang out, please don\\'t hesitate to give me a shout.\"\\nThe Next Neighborhood Robert Sullivan is the author of \"Rats: Observations on the History and Habitat of the City\\'s Most Unwanted Inhabitants\" and \"How Not to Get Rich: Why Being Bad Off Isn\\'t So Bad.\"\\n', '', 'Explosions boomed through a quiet area of Downtown Brooklyn yesterday afternoon after propane tanks ignited during roof work atop a police precinct house, sending the metal tubes sailing like missiles into the streets below, the police said.\\nNo one was injured in the explosions or the brief but spectacular fire that followed. A thick column of ink-black smoke stopped Sunday strollers on the sidewalks. Those closest to the precinct house ran into a McDonald\\'s restaurant at Tillary and Gold Streets.\\nMykel Foreman, 12, who lives nearby, saw and heard the blast. His mother was on the telephone with a 911 operator when the second explosion occurred, he said. His own first fears were dark: \"I thought it was like the terrorists had attacked again, like it was a bomb.\"\\nThe explosions occurred at 3:11 p.m. above the 84th Precinct station, which shares the building at 301 Gold Street with the firehouse for Ladder 110 and Engine 207. Firefighters and police officers evacuated the building, and the fire brought a two-alarm response of more than 100 firefighters. The blaze was quickly extinguished, and a breeze soon cleared away the smoke.  The fire was brought under control at 3:48 p.m., the Fire Department said.\\nThe roofers spoke with fire investigators and police officials outside the building. The workers\\' clothes were darkened with grime and soot, but they otherwise appeared unharmed.\\nFive workers with a company called SCA Asbestos Removal were tarring the roof when the tanks exploded, the police said. Two tanks sailed onto Prince Street, one of them landing on the off-ramp of the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway, large enough to have done great damage to a person or vehicle, but landing on the pavement without injuring anyone. One tank landed on Tillary, a busy thoroughfare any day of the week, but quietest on Sunday.\\nSurrounding blocks and the expressway exit remained closed for hours yesterday afternoon.\\nParamedics leaned on their empty stretchers. Department of Environmental Protection and Department of Buildings officials were inspecting the building yesterday afternoon for asbestos and structural damage before allowing anyone back inside, the police said. Later, the Department of Buildings deemed the buildings \"uncompromised.\"\\nEnvironmental tests for asbestos were pending yesterday evening, said Charles Sturcken, an Environmental Protection Department spokesman.\\nTwo members of the Shomrim community watch patrol, a Hasidic group in Williamsburg, saw the explosion from their window. \"It was very, very powerful, the flames,\" said one of the men, who gave his name as Jacob. \"There was a loud explosion, a ball of fire coming up.\"\\n', 'ON almost any given Sunday, the trumpeter John McNeil walks out of his apartment and down a few tree-lined blocks to Night and Day, a bistro on Fifth Avenue in Park Slope. Since February, Mr. McNeil has held a weekly gig in a rear annex of the restaurant with a quartet he formed with the tenor saxophonist Bill McHenry. A hangout for neighborhood residents and a magnet for musicians, the engagement has become a fixture of Brooklyn\\'s rich and booming jazz scene.\\nThe rise of that scene \\xe2\\x80\\x94 which, like its borough, is an assemblage of enclaves \\xe2\\x80\\x94 has been one of the most significant developments for jazz in New York in recent years. (Every bit as significant as the Brooklyn rock explosion of a few years ago, with which it shouldn\\'t be confused.) Through a growing network of low-rent spaces mostly booked by enterprising musicians, Brooklyn has assumed a vital role in the city\\'s larger jazz culture. And the music has been a boon for listeners of all kinds, including those who have to cross the East River to hear it.\\nTo his great delight, Mr. McNeil barely has to cross the street. \"I\\'ve lived here since the early 1970\\'s,\" he said one Sunday, between sets at Night and Day. For a long time he was one of many Brooklyn jazz citizens who had to travel to Manhattan for staples of employment and entertainment. Many musicians still make that commute, occasionally to perform at marquee clubs like the Blue Note and the Village Vanguard, but more often to hold court in small rooms like the 55 Bar, Fat Cat and the Cornelia Street Caf\\xc3\\xa9, which is owned by Robin Hirsch, one of two partners behind Night and Day.\\nIn a sense Brooklyn\\'s jazz clubs operate on the same plane as those West Village bars. (It\\'s not uncommon for a group to play one night at the 55 Bar and the next at a spot in Brooklyn.) The difference between the two scenes, in terms of audience, is outlined succinctly by Mr. Hirsch, based on firsthand expertise: \"The Village will draw an international crowd, while Park Slope is strictly local.\"\\nCertainly the crowd is overwhelmingly local at Tea Lounge on Union Street in Park Slope. Walk into the cavernous coffeehouse on a Thursday or Friday night, and you\\'ll probably spot a few strollers nestled among the couches, along with laptop computers and stylish casual attire. You\\'ll also see adventurous young jazz musicians playing for tips, since Tea Lounge doesn\\'t have a cover charge.\\nThat policy attracts an audience more random and robust than the musicians might otherwise hope to reach, especially in Manhattan. This winter the alto saxophonist Andrew D\\'Angelo played one show to more than 100 people, a large crowd for an avant-garde jazz show. Some of the listeners  paid a suggested donation; others merely paid attention. Oren Arnon, who books the room, recently pegged its vibe: \"a combination of quality jazz and something social, which doesn\\'t happen often enough in this city.\"\\nA similar ethos prevails at Barb\\xc3\\xa8s, universally acknowledged as the vanguard (Village Vanguard, even) of the new Brooklyn jazz  scene. \"We tried to build a no-pressure environment for audiences and musicians,\" said Olivier Conan, who owns the bar with a fellow French expatriate and musician, Vincent Douglas. The club\\'s success confirms the wisdom of that premise.\\nBarb\\xc3\\xa8s may be the place most responsible for the perception of a Brooklyn jazz renaissance. Its cozy dimensions suit small audiences and rapt attention. And its booking describes a rough bouquet of sounds: from French musette to Brazilian forr\\xc3\\xb3, as well as  multiple strains of jazz, from Gypsy swing to collective free improvisation.\\nLong-term residencies, hardly a staple in Manhattan, are a prominent feature of the programming at Barb\\xc3\\xa8s. The violinist Jenny Scheinman usually plays on Tuesday nights, seasoning her music with flecks of jazz, classical and rustic folk. Wednesdays are devoted to an avant-garde series organized by the saxophonist Micha\\xc3\\xabl Attias. (He isn\\'t the only musician maintaining a series in the area; six blocks south, the keyboardist James Carney books Sunday nights at Bar 4, a red-lighted dive.)\\nLast month the clarinetist and saxophonist Chris Speed started Skirl, an independent record label with the express purpose of documenting some of the experimental artists in the regular Barb\\xc3\\xa8s orbit. The label\\'s next release party is scheduled for Thursday at the club.\\nExperimentation and eclecticism are hardly limited to Park Slope. In Williamsburg they converge at Rose Live Music, a stylish lounge on Grand Street that opened just a few months ago. They come together even more explicitly during the Williamsburg Jazz Festival, which will have its fourth season in September.\\nBut nothing beats the neighborhood\\'s leading spot, Zebulon Caf\\xc3\\xa9 Concert, which combines the flea-market chic of Barb\\xc3\\xa8s (the owners, Guillaume Blestel and Jef and Jocelyn Soubiran, are French) with the no-cover rule of Tea Lounge (but with one significant distinction: every artist receives a guarantee). Zebulon\\'s programming has lately leaned markedly toward world music, but the free-jazz violinist Billy Bang has made notable appearances, as has the composer and conductor Butch Morris.\\nMr. Morris also helped inaugurate a more extreme outpost, the nonprofit Issue Project Room, when it relocated last June from the East Village into a silo on the Gowanus Canal. \"The industrial environment tends to inspire a rugged sort of experimentation,\" said Suzanne Fiol, the organization\\'s director, hours before a recent premiere by the Japanese composer Shoko Nagai.\\nRugged experimentation of a different sort was one hallmark of the jazz scene in Brooklyn during its original heyday, from the late 1950\\'s through the 60\\'s. Throughout those years a cluster of African-American establishments thrived around Fulton Street and Nostrand Avenue.\\nOne of them, the Blue Coronet, served as a laboratory for youngbloods like the tenor saxophonist Wayne Shorter and the trumpeter Freddie Hubbard. Another was immortalized by Mr. Hubbard with a 1965 Blue Note album called \"The Night of the Cookers: Live at Club La Marchal,\" on which he locked horns with Lee Morgan in a casual but heated exchange.\\n\"Going back to 1960, there was something loosely called a Brooklyn sound,\" said Robert Myers, referring in part to that album. \"And it started with the venues, which gave the musicians license to explore new avenues onstage and not be confined by management.\" Until the close of 2004 Mr. Myers operated Up Over Jazz Caf\\xc3\\xa9, a bar on Flatbush Avenue that fulfilled a similar function for the latest generation of post-bop strivers, like the tenor saxophonist Marcus Strickland and the pianist Robert Glasper.\\nMr. Glasper provides an illustrative example of the current Brooklyn-Manhattan jazz symbiosis. He arrived in the city at the tail end of the 1990\\'s, settling in Brooklyn but matriculating at the New School University in Manhattan. He quickly plugged into a circuit of jam sessions stretching from Freddy\\'s Backroom, on Dean Street in Park Slope, to Smalls, a crucible of young talent in Greenwich Village.\\nAt Up Over Jazz he found steady work and a space to hone his craft. But after he earned the imprimatur of a Blue Note Records contract, his next career move was clear: a week at the Village Vanguard. (He concludes his second engagement there this weekend with his trio.)\\nMr. Glasper\\'s example also illustrates the existence of a parallel Brooklyn jazz movement among African-Americans in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Fort Greene and Clinton Hill. Self-consciously styled as a revival of Brooklyn\\'s golden era, this scene includes institutions like Jazz 966, a series held for the last 16 years at the Fort Greene Senior Citizens Council; 651 Arts, a nonprofit concert presenting organization; and the Concord Baptist Church, which holds occasional jazz services. In April a consortium of these and other groups mounted the seventh annual Central Brooklyn Jazz Festival, with \"Jazz: A Music of the Spirit\" as its theme.\\nThe author of that theme, the trumpeter  Ahmed Abdullah, was a visible presence during the festival, especially at Sista\\'s Place, a communally owned coffeehouse and salon in Bedford-Stuyvesant. \"African-Americans have rarely owned the music\\'s means of production,\" he said in a phone conversation. \"The music has to be in our community if it\\'s going to grow. We\\'ve got to have an alternative to mainstream institutions.\"\\nThe crowd that packed Sista\\'s Place one rainy Saturday for a festival performance by the trumpeter Charles Tolliver made it look as if Mr. Abdullah\\'s objective was being fulfilled. Less expectedly, his words seemed nearly as pertinent to a performance held on the same night at the Center for Improvisational Music, or CIM, a nonprofit educational effort run by the trumpeter Ralph Alessi near the northern stretch of the Gowanus Canal.\\nIt featured the alto saxophonist Tim Berne, one of the early homesteaders of the newly ascendant Brooklyn jazz community. Mr. Berne long ago claimed ownership of his music\\'s means of production with a self-sustaining record label based in a brownstone near Flatbush Avenue. And he has spent most of his career on the alternative fringe of jazz culture, though his audience at CIM included a couple of industry veterans like Jeff Levenson, who has a working affiliation with the Blue Note, one of New York\\'s most obvious mainstream jazz institutions.\\n\"Brooklyn is essentially an incubator, where a lot of things get messed with and hybridized,\" Mr. Levenson said later, speaking as an almost 30-year resident of the borough. \"I think an audience approaches that experience differently than the audience that comes to the Blue Note. There\\'s a different agenda, a different motivation. We\\'re talking works in progress, which moderates the expectation levels.\"\\nA good many Brooklyn musicians would agree with that characterization, which casts the borough\\'s jazz scene almost in the role of a loose-and-limber Triple-A  baseball team. (Higher in the pecking order than the Class A Brooklyn Cyclones, anyway.) But the idea probably wouldn\\'t sit well with Mr. Abdullah, who sees community-based creative action as a goal in itself.\\nNor for different reasons would it agree with the percussionist Matt Moran, who leads Slavic Soul Party, an improviser-stocked Balkan brass band that performs on Tuesdays at Barb\\xc3\\xa8s, after Ms. Scheinman. \"Maybe this started out as a place where people workshop things,\" Mr. Moran said outside the club recently, between sets. \"But it\\'s on the radar now, and you need to step up and present your work in the best possible light.\"\\n\"It has really arrived as a scene,\" he continued, gathering steam. \"People are saying, \\'I\\'m not going to step into the shininess of Manhattan, I\\'m going to do it in my own earthy way.\\' And rather than struggling in obscurity, they\\'re finding that now it\\'s a celebrated thing.\"\\n', 'MIGUEL HERN\\xc3\\x81NDEZ of Ossining is the only Hispanic mayor in  New York State, though  that distinction took effect early this month and will last only until year\\'s end.\\nStill, what a statement those seven months will be about how polychrome Cheever country has become. Most Americans still think of Westchester as white, and white bread, except when an urban anomaly like Yonkers conquers that stereotype. But the county, like the country, turns out to have lots of everything, even in its villages. In Ossining, Port Chester, and Sleepy Hollow, Hispanics are a major force.\\n\"I don\\'t want to make a big deal of it \\xe2\\x80\\x94 it\\'s only a part-time job,\" the unassuming Mr. Hern\\xc3\\xa1ndez said of the unassuming $12,000-a-year position. \"But it sends a message that the Hispanic community is maturing and moving into the mainstream.\"\\nThe county has one Hispanic legislator, Jos\\xc3\\xa9 I. Alvarado of Yonkers, and a tier of Hispanic movers and shakers like Felix Sanchez, a lawyer in Yonkers; Gilbert Torres, a financial adviser in White Plains; and Maria Perez, who runs an advertising firm in Elmsford. Westchesterites are glad that they can table-hop among Hispanic cuisines in Port Chester, but they are becoming aware that Hispanic merchants now run lots of shops on whiter village main streets.\\n\"They\\'re the new mom and pop,\" said Brian Nickerson, director of  Pace University\\'s Michaelian Institute for Public Policy and Management in White Plains.\\nIn that mix, Mr. Hern\\xc3\\xa1ndez turns out to be not just another ethnic pol, but an erudite 67-year-old published military historian who drives a Mini Cooper and is a connoisseur of the Croton Aqueduct and Ossining itself. Bet you didn\\'t know this village was first named Sing Sing but changed its name to distance itself from the Big House up the River.\\nMr. Hern\\xc3\\xa1ndez, a stocky, mustached man with leonine patches of white hair, reminds you he is mayor, not acting mayor. A Democrat, he was chosen from among four village trustees after the elected mayor resigned, and he will have to surrender his job at the end of the year because his party chose another candidate to run for the next two-year term.\\nAs a trustee since 2000, he helped arrange a pickup point for day laborers near the community center. But in the short time he has left, he wants to be mayor for all of Ossining\\'s 24,000 people, not just its 7,000 Hispanics. Like many migrants, he has  moved beyond his roots, in his case the coffee-lush mountains of Puerto Rico and the mean streets of East Williamsburg, in Brooklyn, where his mother, a factory worker, died when he was 15 and his father, a pipe fitter, when he was 21.\\nHe wants to spruce up Main Street\\'s fraying gingerbread facades, complete a seven-story apartment building on a once ramshackle waterfront, and build a river walk to let strollers \\xe2\\x80\\x94 not just prison guards \\xe2\\x80\\x94 soak in the Hudson River views. He wants to call attention to an Ossining gem, the gabled cottage once owned by Clement Clarke Moore, who is credited with the children\\'s poem that begins \" \\'Twas the night before Christmas.\"\\n\"People think Ossining is gritty and urban, and it certainly has that aspect to it, but then there\\'s a neighborhood like this,\" Mayor Hern\\xc3\\xa1ndez said.\\nHe wants to open two museums, one that capitalizes on Sing Sing and another centered on immigration.\\n\"We need some place where people can say, \\'My ancestors came here and built this community, and here is the proof,\\' \" he said.\\nSome Hispanic migrants settled in small villages like Ossining because they grew up in Caribbean or Latin American villages. Others wanted backyards and good schools, like Mr. Hern\\xc3\\xa1ndez, who left Brooklyn in 1981 for an $86,000 house (though he still sprinkles his conversation with New York Yiddishisms, as in \"I\\'ll show you the whole megillah\"). Just because Ossining had many Hispanics did not mean he would have much in common with all of them, he likes to emphasize.\\n\"We are different tribes,\" he said. \"The analogy I make is with the Brits. We\\'re divided by a common tongue.\"\\nMr. Hern\\xc3\\xa1ndez knows about divisions. He worked as a Justice Department mediator in the 71-day standoff between Indians and federal authorities in 1973 at Wounded Knee, S.D. Later, as the executive director of New York City\\'s Human Rights Commission, he negotiated a public-housing settlement between Hasidim and Puerto Ricans in Williamsburg.\\nWhen he looks at the engineering marvel of the aqueduct, he recalls that it was built by Irishmen who set up camps in places that are now Sleepy Hollow and Ossining and came to dominate those municipalities. The Irish of Ossining have prospered and are less drawn to politics. But there\\'s a new force of laborers \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and professionals like Mr. Hern\\xc3\\xa1ndez \\xe2\\x80\\x94 waiting in the wings.\\n', '', 'KIRYAS JOEL, N.Y., Aug. 22 \\xe2\\x80\\x94 As the administrator of this village in southern Orange County, Gedalye Szegedin knows that much of his job revolves around a simple equation: the number of girls who get married is roughly equal to the number of new homes this community will need to accommodate its rapid growth.\\nLast year, Mr. Szegedin oversaw the construction of 200 houses and apartments, mostly on the outer-lying lots along the eastern edge of this 1.1-square-mile community, an ultra-Orthodox Jewish enclave about 60 miles north of Midtown Manhattan. By the end of this year, he said, the village will most likely have 300 new homes.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere are three religious tenets that drive our growth: our women don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t use birth control, they get married young and after they get married, they stay in Kiryas Joel and start a family,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Szegedin said.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOur growth comes simply from the fact that our families have a lot of babies,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he added, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand we need to build homes to respond to the needs of our community.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nBut developable land is a finite resource here, and not much of it is left. And as Kiryas Joel pushes up against its borders, nearby neighbors in the towns of Blooming Grove and Woodbury are moving aggressively to prevent the community from expanding by incorporating into villages of their own.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe still have huge tracts of open land in Woodbury, and we want to keep it that way,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Woodbury\\xe2\\x80\\x99s supervisor, John P. Burke, who grew up in the Bronx and moved to Orange County in 1969.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe want to make sure that no outside community is able to completely transform the character and the look of our town,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf we need a village to do that, so be it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nKiryas Joel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s population leaped to 18,300 last year from 13,100 in 2000 and 7,400 in 1990, making it one of the fastest growing places in the state, according to the most recent estimates by the Census Bureau. For two years, developers and local officials have been searching for private parcels in surrounding communities, hoping to expand the village through annexation for the third time since it was incorporated in 1977 as an offshoot of the Satmar Hasidic sect of Williamsburg, Brooklyn.\\nAfter its incorporation, most of the growth was driven by migration from New York City. But now, new arrivals are mostly babies and grooms coming to marry one of the local women.\\nWorried residents in Blooming Grove, which lies northwest of here, and Woodbury, which lies east,  have voted overwhelmingly in the past two months to approve the creation of two new villages. State law allows villages to be established within towns and to set their own zoning regulations, and area officials say the new villages would be able to restrict the multifamily, high-density building that predominates in Kiryas Joel.\\nMany of the families in those towns also fled the crowded streets of New York City, moving here for the cleaner air, the safer communities and the open spaces, where the closest neighbor may not be so close.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re hard-working people who decided to move up here to pay less taxes and enjoy the quietness of country,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Garry Dugan, a retired New York City detective and the president of the South Blooming Grove Homeowners Association, the group that began the drive to create one of the villages.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a shame that it has come to us and them, but we feel like we had to form a village for no reason other than preserving our quality of life,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Dugan, who has lived in Blooming Grove for 26 years. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis has nothing to do with their religion.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nIt is not the first time that Kiryas Joel and its neighbors have clashed.\\nOver the years, there have been disputes \\xe2\\x80\\x94 over a water pipeline Kiryas Joel sought to build, for example, and whether the state should pay for a school system for its disabled students. There was also an argument in 1986 when 600 Kiryas Joel boys refused to board school buses driven by women. (The drivers are now all men.)\\nThe Satmar Hasidim share what they call a deep mystical connection to Kiryas Joel. They were led here by their founder, the Grand Rabbi Joel Teitelbaum, who saw in it the ideal place for his followers to raise large families away from the influences of the outside world. Hence the name of the village, which means Town of Joel.\\nAbout 3,000 families live here, many of them in boxy wood-frame homes built close to one another, with up to a dozen apartments stacked in four floors.\\nThe village has no parks or public playgrounds, so children play with their colorful plastic toys on small front yards.\\nA network of sidewalks twirl across the village, so the women, who do not drive, are able to walk to the clinic and supermarket. Baby strollers seem to be everywhere: in the lobbies of buildings, on sidewalks, outside the stores.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is a great place to raise our children; it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s easy to keep them away from the distractions of the city,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Judith Greenfeld, 34, whose family moved here from Williamsburg two decades ago.\\nAll but 3 of her 12 siblings live here.\\nMrs. Greenfeld and her husband, Joseph, 35, have five children, three boys and two girls, ages 3 to 13. The median age is 15, compared with 35 for the nation, according to the 2000 census. The village has one of the lowest median ages among communities nationwide with more than 5,000 residents.\\nThe Greenfelds live on a dead-end street, in a third-floor apartment across from a girls\\xe2\\x80\\x99 school. Like most families here, they speak more Yiddish than English and have no radio, computer or television at home. Mr. Greenfeld owns a tile shop in Monroe, just outside the village borders.\\nHis wife helps him run the business, which makes her a rare exception among Kiryas Joel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s women, who are married soon after they graduate from high school, work until they give birth to their second child and then become stay-at-home mothers. The men, meanwhile, board yellow school buses every morning and ride to New York City, to jobs in the diamond district or at B & H, the photo and video store near Herald Square.\\nBecause of the sheer size of the families (the average household here has six people, but it is not uncommon for couples to have 8 or 10 children), and because a vast majority of households subsist on only one salary, 62 percent of the local families live below poverty level and rely heavily on public assistance, which is another sore point among those who live in neighboring communities.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe just don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t understand why they have to keep pushing their expansionist ideas on us,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Charles J. Bohan, who is the supervisor of the Town of Blooming Grove and a resident of the new village, named South Blooming Grove.\\nOn Sept. 21, South Blooming Grove will hold its first election for mayor and for a four-member board of trustees. The state must still certify the results of the vote to create the village in Woodbury before elections there can be held.\\nMr. Szegedin, Kiryas Joel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s administrator, said his community was not deterred.\\n\"We have several different developers that want to sell land to Kiryas Joel, but if they can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do it, we can build up,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe can change our zoning code to allow high-rise apartments. The creation of these villages are not going to stop the growth in the village of Kiryas Joel.\"\\nMrs. Greenfeld agreed.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPeople don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t understand the conception of our people, of our religion,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no government or land or any other authority that can stop us from having babies,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said while her husband put out a plate of cheese blintzes, strawberries and sour cream.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not enough land, families will double up. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s always going to be room for the new families,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mrs. Greenfeld said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd if I have to slice up my apartment in two, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll do it, without doubt or hesitation.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n', 'In New York City, Bohemia is determined by real estate: artists gather in raffish neighborhoods where studio space is cheap; the new outposts of culture and consumption they establish make the quarter desirable, thus raising the rents to prohibitive levels; the artists then decamp for the next shabby enclave. Starting in the 1960\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, what New Yorkers meant by \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdowntown\\xe2\\x80\\x9d shifted from Greenwich Village to SoHo to TriBeCa to the Lower East Side. But Manhattan is a narrow island, and the portion of it dense enough to sustain the feeling of self-enclosure that Bohemia requires is quite small. And so, starting in the 1980\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, as rents skyrocketed, downtown began to migrate across the East River to Brooklyn.\\nBy now, those portions of Brooklyn first colonized by fleeing artists have almost completed the cycle of embourgeoisement. Williamsburg, the heart of Brooklyn\\xe2\\x80\\x99s gallery scene, has been thoroughly tamed by brasseries and boutiques; the kind of artists who aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t yet showing in those galleries are now moving to deepest, darkest Queens. But the middle-class householder geography of Queens offers too barren a soil for the rooting of a new Bohemia. Fortunately, there is lots more Brooklyn available.\\nThere is, of course, something wishful, or perhaps wistful, about this perpetual hunt for the urban El Dorado. A place that can shift around so easily sounds less like a neighborhood than a mentality, or a species of nostalgia. In most of America, after all, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdowntown\\xe2\\x80\\x9d simply means \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe city\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the place where things are close enough to one another that you can walk. But in New York, where every square inch feels urban, downtown is a refuge from \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a repudiation of \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the conventionality of Midtown, and mid-everything. Downtown is a concept, and perhaps an archaic one.\\nThe idea of Bohemia arose with the bourgeois city, against which it defined itself. In the Paris of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLa Boh\\xc3\\xa8me\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the Latin Quarter, circa 1830 \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the artist willingly courts starvation and disease as the price of freedom. The poet Rodolfo may be giddy as he shovels his manuscript into the fire to keep warm, but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s still the only source of fuel he has. Life was scarcely less desperate \\xe2\\x80\\x94 or less delightful \\xe2\\x80\\x94 in the downtown Manhattan of 1910, when the poet and propagandist John Reed, according to one biographer, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cate in obscure foreign restaurants, talked with the girls who walked the street in \\xe2\\x80\\x98Satan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Circus\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and caroused with Spanish longshoremen.\\nReed\\xe2\\x80\\x99s latter-day descendants are threatened not by penury but by gentrification. How can Bohemia contend with the twin baby stroller? The other day, walking around Fort Greene, one of Brooklyn\\xe2\\x80\\x99s current claimants to downtown cultural status, I stopped at an office building called 80 Arts. In the Museum of Contemporary African Diaspora Arts, or MoCADA, which occupies the ground floor, an exhibition of major black artists had just come down. I picked up some fliers from the counter. One, issued by a company called Downtown Babies, advertised \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCreative Play and Music Classes\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThemed Birthday Parties\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to be held at MoCADA. Downtown Babies \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the end of Bohemia as we know it.\\n80 Arts had been gutted and renovated as part of a \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccultural district\\xe2\\x80\\x9d established by a \\xe2\\x80\\x9clocal development corporation\\xe2\\x80\\x9d organized around the Brooklyn Academy of Music, the cultural mega-institution of Fort Greene. Here was a planned Bohemia \\xe2\\x80\\x94 surely a contradiction in terms. Indeed, many locals, and local organizations, had protested the development (as they are now even more loudly protesting the Atlantic Yards, a nearby mega-project featuring skyscrapers and a basketball stadium to be designed by Frank Gehry). But MoCADA owes its presence in Fort Greene to the cultural district; should the project be fully implemented, a new theater and public library will be built as well.\\nIn short, downtown, or the idea of downtown, has become thoroughly implicated in the cultural and economic forces that it once resisted with every ounce of its scruffy integrity. The misfits and longhairs and revolutionaries deemed unassimilable by mainstream culture in John Reed\\xe2\\x80\\x99s day are now considered \\xe2\\x80\\x9cedgy\\xe2\\x80\\x9d; and edge, in turn, attracts sneaker stores and bistros and cultural entrepreneurs and even young couples with strollers. The derri\\xc3\\xa8re-garde keeps catching up with the avant-garde; the avant-garde falls prey to its own lurid appeal. If Rodolfo\\xe2\\x80\\x99s artist pal Marcello were around today, his gallery opening would be catered by Absolut.\\nAnd so the Bohemias of yesteryear have gone the way of Reed\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Spanish longshoremen. But is that so bad? Take a walk in Fort Greene, an ethnically and economically mixed neighborhood with tree-lined blocks of fine brick homes. A block away from 80 Arts, beyond the town house that the painter David Salle has lavishly rehabilitated, lies the lime-green Habana Outpost, an eco-friendly cafe where mothers push downtown babies on swings amid racks of folkloric skirts, priced to sell. And then, moving up Fulton Street, once a commercial swamp, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the wine store and the soul-food restaurant and the beloved Cake Man Raven. A few blocks away stands the Brooklyn Academy of Music, which has been irreproachably avant-garde since long before there was any money in it. Fort Greene feels less like Bohemia than what the scholar Joel Kotkin calls an \\xe2\\x80\\x9celite urban enclave\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a place suited to the sophisticated tastes of the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cknowledge workers\\xe2\\x80\\x9d who now propel New York\\xe2\\x80\\x99s economy.\\nBut the wheel of development that brought in those young cosmopolites, and priced out a number of the area\\xe2\\x80\\x99s longtime, predominantly black residents, has not stopped turning: the Atlantic Yards project threatens to disrupt Fort Greene\\xe2\\x80\\x99s delicate ecology once again. We want to preserve our precious and beloved utopias like paperweight worlds; but the city \\xe2\\x80\\x94 at least this city \\xe2\\x80\\x94 will not permit it.\\n', 'LAST week I was trying to find gifts for newborn twins adopted by an architect friend and his graphic designer husband who live in Los Angeles. They are two new additions to the many, many children I know now.

Its high-design offerings make it a prime location for the sharpest \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and sometimes most perverse \\xe2\\x80\\x94 children\\xe2\\x80\\x99s products.\\nMini Jake was started by David Jacobs and his wife, Inga Rogers, as an offshoot of Two Jakes, the office furniture store that Mr. Jacobs owns with his brother. In 2005, he put out a couple of cribs in the shop, and after witnessing the rabid response, opened Mini Jake, which is dedicated to children\\xe2\\x80\\x99s furniture. Mini Jake soon outgrew the space like training pants, and moved into this 3,000-square-foot warehouse in June.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cEveryone who was buying Dwell and Eames chairs suddenly had kids,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Jacobs said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere was a void to fill.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nWith 20-foot ceilings and two skylights, the light-drenched space is divided into sections that include toys, books, bags, buggies, bedding, newborn essentials and, in the center, a grid of cribs, dressers, rockers and bassinets, all as shiny and presentable as new cars. The store is dustless, colorful and clean-lined \\xe2\\x80\\x94 sort of how I imagine a day care center in Copenhagen to look.\\nAnd, actually, as I walked around the store, I began to notice a predominance of Nordic names: Flensted Mobiles, Svan Bouncer, a loom from the Swedish toy company Brio. In the front of the store were pieces of layered foam carved into fish, pig, giraffe and elephant shapes, made by the Danish company bObles ($39 each). Just now being introduced in the United States, they seem like cooler, chic Nerf balls. A box showed a child standing on one of them, with blunt-cut bangs and a fulfilled Danish smile.\\nI hovered over the Haba Kugelbahn ($84.95), a set of troughs and chutes for marbles, which I wanted to tear open and play with on the chalkboard-topped Fundy play table ($399.95). Then I spent a long time marveling over the Antquarium ($24.99), an ant farm filled with a clear gel so you can fully see your pet insects at work. Everything was so spotless and clever, it made all the detritus I grew up with \\xe2\\x80\\x94 plastic highchairs, Legos, Fisher-Price toys, awkward potty seats \\xe2\\x80\\x94 look like clunky artifacts from a primitive culture.\\nIT was surprisingly quiet when I was there. Two fashionable mothers sauntered around, their children comatose in strollers. One woman was in a trendy lime-green sack dress with her long hair loosely bunched up in the back. She roamed around the diaper bags with the same focus she had probably given to a pair of Jimmy Choo slingbacks 10 years earlier.\\nOne contraption that caught my eye was the Stokke Xplory stroller, which has an elevated seat and a horizontal bed for a baby. Intended tor lift your children away from the street and place them  closer to you, the stroller looks like an overdesigned lunch cart. According to the Mini Jake Web site, the design is also meant to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cstimulate the all important social interaction between parent and child,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d thus promoting bonding.\\nThe complete stroller, which includes an attachable bassinet, costs $999. It is the most expensive stroller in the store, even more expensive than the notorious Bugaboo Frog, which at $759 transformed the industry when it appeared on the market in 1999, rejiggering the price point for the simple stroller much like Starbucks normalized the $2 coffee.\\nNot all of the products here are from Northern Europe. Of the eight cribs displayed on the floor, four are made by local designers, including one from Oeuf in Brooklyn ($824 for birch) that can transform into a toddler bed if you buy the $202 conversion kit. Supposedly this makes the child\\xe2\\x80\\x99s transition from crib to a first bed less upsetting, giving parents a better chance at catching a bit more sleep.\\nMany of the pricey items here justify themselves by purporting to be adaptable as your child grows: bassinet to buggy, crib to bed. One of the odder looking pieces was the Cocoon from the Phil & Teds line ($59.95). The thick, bright green insulated bag is used to transport your baby but looks disturbingly like a beer cooler.\\nDespite all of this selective high-tech merchandise, Mr. Jacobs is not at all the design snob you might assume he would be. There may be items here that give you sticker shock, or wipe out your child\\xe2\\x80\\x99s college fund before you have even started it, but he and the store give off a good energy. He and Ms. Rogers have two children \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Jackson, 6, and Phoebe, 3 \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and Mr. Jacobs comes off as your normal, honest, mellow dad operating on one REM cycle.\\nFor the twins, he suggested I go local and get \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBow-Wow Bugs a Bug\\xe2\\x80\\x9d ($12.95), a book by the New York artists Mark Newgarden and Megan Montague Cash, and the album \\xe2\\x80\\x9cRocket Ship Beach\\xe2\\x80\\x9d ($14.95) by the rocker turned children\\xe2\\x80\\x99s music megastar, Dan Zanes. I bought both the book and the CD, hoping that Zanes had not achieved Bono-like status in the children\\xe2\\x80\\x99s music scene on the West Coast as he has in Brooklyn. If these gifts aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t a hit, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to get them a subscription to Vanity Fair and call it a day.\\nMini Jake\\n178 North Ninth Street (between Bedford and Driggs Avenues), Williamsburg,\\nBrooklyn; (718) 782-2005.\\nTOT DESIGN A bright atrium filled with cutting-edge children\\xe2\\x80\\x99s furniture, bedding, accessories and toys.

Even when he wrote \\nto Patrick Henry College about the year that had set the course \\nof his life-the year when he, a homeschooled missionary\\'s kid \\nfrom a depressed suburb of Akron, got to see President George \\nW. Bush in person-Derek kept his hubris in check. \"I would be a \\nfool to believe I made it through the past few months by my might \\nand my power, for truly it was by the Lord\\'s grace and His Spirit \\nalone!\"\\nDerek was not one of the school\\'s usual incoming freshman \\nstars known as \"the 1600s\"-the handful of kids each year who \\nget perfect scores on their SATs and ignore courting letters from \\nHarvard and Stanford to come to Patrick Henry. What he had was \\nnot something the six-year-old college could easily boast about \\nin press releases, but what it valued much more: a near-perfect \\nbalance of ambition and humility, the one impulse pushing him \\ntoward the White House and the other always reminding him \\nWho was really in charge.\\nIn a few heady months during the fall of 2004, the Bush campaign \\nhad served as one endless, amazing high school field trip-better \\nthan going to Europe or Disneyland or Papua, New Guinea, \\nwhere his family once lived in a house on stilts. He had made \\nphone calls and knocked on doors in the critical swing districts in \\nOhio, near where he lived. He had won a contest for registering \\nmore than 100 voters. He had learned to take verbal abuse with \\ngrace. He had created a minor local celebrity by writing articles \\nand flyers under the fogyish nom de plume \"Franz Holbein\" who \\ncomplained about \"some of the most appalling displays of disrespect \\nthis nation has ever seen.\" Twenty minutes before the polls \\nclosed, a car full of rowdies whizzed by him, screaming \"Kerry \\nwon! Kerry won!\" He prayed it couldn\\'t be true, and his prayers \\nwere answered. In the battle between the \"forces of righteousness \\nand unrighteousness,\" the right side had won.\\n\"Those few months have had a powerful impact on my life in \\npreparing me for the ministry of political activism,\" he wrote to \\nPatrick Henry. \"If in any matter I can bring glory to my God and \\nKing, may He grant me the grace to do just that.\"\\nIt\\'s not just that Derek was a missionary\\'s kid and knew how \\nto say the right things. Patrick Henry prides itself on not being \\nyour run-of-the-mill Bible college: It doesn\\'t give automatic preference \\nto MKs, who can be just as rotten as any kids. Instead the \\nschool takes the measure of its students constantly, probing the \\nnature of each individual\\'s personal relationship with Jesus Christ \\nwith the care and trepidation of a parent monitoring a fever, or a \\nschoolgirl checking whether you\\'re still her best friend. Under \\nthat microscope, Derek glowed.\\nGod\\'s voice was like the sound track to the movie of Derek\\'s \\nlife, lending texture and meaning to every action. In return, Derek \\nthanked God for everything. He thanked Him when a seemingly \\nchance meeting led to a great internship at the local Republican \\nheadquarters. \"The Lord just dropped that one into my lap!\" He \\nthanked Him for his mom sending his favorite granola bars, for his \\nsister passing her driving test, for the extra cheese on his turkey \\nsub. He thanked Him for his new used car, although it was dark \\npurple and the AC didn\\'t work and the windows seemed to be \\nglued shut. He thanked Him for his after-school job at Leach\\'s \\nMeats and Sweets down the road, where he worked in the chilly \\nback room hacking up raw chickens and grinding up beef to stuff \\ninto their \"famous\" sausages while tolerating the boss\\'s son\\'s endless \\ntracks of AC/DC (\"the worst band in the whole wide world\").\\n\"It\\'s really been a blessing,\" he told me one day as he wiped his \\nknife on an apron streaked with bloodstains.\\nIn the year before he left for college, Derek had moved down \\nto the basement of his parents\\' house in Barberton, six miles \\nsouth of Akron. In the evenings, his mom, Donna Archer, would \\ngo down there to drop off his clean laundry \"and see if he\\'s ready \\nto hit the hay, and I\\'d find him down on his knees praying. As a \\nChristian mom, nothing thrills me more. Nobody was watching \\nhim; it\\'s the real thing. He doesn\\'t do it to please us. You can see \\nGod\\'s spirit at work in him.\"\\n\"Because of that,\" his mom added, \"I\\'m not worried if he \\nheads into politics.\"\\nFor Patrick Henry College, Derek was a white sheep, the son \\nyou were pretty sure wouldn\\'t roll his eyes at you the minute you \\nturned your head or sneak a cigarette outside his dorm window at \\nnight. The school thought of itself as a training ground for political \\nmissionaries; its founder, Michael Farris, traveled the country \\nrecruiting conservative Christian kids like Derek who were \\nbright, politically minded, and itching to be near the president. \\nFarris was aware of the risks of launching them into the cutthroat \\nand dirty world of politics: He could unwittingly turn out to be \\nthe agent of their corruption, involving them in what Derek \\nhad once heard described by a pastor as \"an innately wicked endeavor.\" \\nSo Derek was a particular gem, a boy who, as much as \\nanyone this side of heaven, seemed incorruptible.\\n\"Okay. Here goes,\" Derek said, as he spotted the Welcome Students \\nsign hanging in Founders Hall. Like most of the kids who \\ngo to Patrick Henry, Derek was homeschooled by his parents all \\nthe way through high school, so college could be a shock. But during \\norientation week the campus still felt warm and familiar, like \\na big homeschool family reunion. The central buildings and dorms \\nwere packed with typically oversized homeschooling families-ten-year-old  \\ngirls pushing strollers, toddlers scrambling after their \\npregnant moms like baby ducks. The little kids were eerily independent \\nand well behaved; they sat in circles on the grass or outside \\nthe cafeteria, playing games or reading the campus maps for \\nfun. The incoming freshmen boys, meanwhile, looked like children \\nplaying the role of adults in a high school play, with crisp \\nwhite polo shirts, new leather computer bags, and their last bits of \\nacne. The girls wore twin sets over their khakis or black slacks, \\nwhich surprised Derek\\'s mom. \"Okay, this is going to be more casual \\ndress for the girls than I thought,\" said Donna, whose daughter \\ngoes to a Christian school where skirts are required. But, she \\nadded, \"I\\'m happy for the lack of tattoos and piercings.\"\\nA handful of families looked like reenactors lost on their way \\nto Colonial Williamsburg: mothers in braids carrying babies in \\nbonnets, girls in their best Laura Ingalls Wilder white-collared \\ndresses taking a stroll around the lake-a tableau that made the \\ncampus feel a century-not an hour-away from downtown \\nWashington, D.C. The parking lot was jammed with vans bearing \\nmessages on their bumpers: TRUTH, or BUSH/CHENEY, or LIFE. \\nOne license plate read MOMOF8.\\nDerek, who has blue eyes and sharply parted blond hair, already \\nhad business casual down. He was wearing an oxford shirt \\nand khakis and sneakers that looked recently cleaned. Like many \\nhomeschooled boys, Derek seemed both old and young for his \\nage. If he was in a good mood, he bounced more than walked and \\nwhistled, like Dennis without the menace, or an old contented \\npreacher lost in happy thoughts. With his tall frame, gangly arms, \\nand big grin, he was built for stand-up comedy but he was more \\noften straining to seem more serious. He was polite and sometimes \\nabsurdly formal, and when he was talking to an adult and \\nfeeling nervous, he used constructions more appropriate for the \\nwitness stand. (\"Yes, ma\\'am, I have been to this campus on two \\nprior occasions.\")\\nThe campus is tiny, less like an Ivy League college than like a \\nHollywood set of an old Ivy League school, with one main building \\nand several dorms grouped around a lake, all in Federalist \\nstyle. The art in Founders Hall is designed to remind the students \\nthat America was founded as a Christian nation-a gallery \\nof portraits of the Founding Fathers, all copies, leads up the staircase \\nto the picture of Patrick Henry at the second Virginia convention, \\na shaft of light from Heaven guiding his speech. \"Harvard \\nfor Homeschoolers,\" founder Michael Farris likes to call it, invoking \\nthe Harvard of earlier days, whose laws instructed students \\nto \"know God and Jesus Christ.\"\\nThe last time Derek was on campus, his assigned dorm hadn\\'t \\nbeen built yet, and when he saw it, he was impressed. \"So stately,\" \\nhe said, noting the chandelier in the entranceway and the winding \\nstaircase leading up to his room on the second floor. But the \\nfirst thing that struck me about the boys\\' dorms was what was \\nmissing. Even during moving week, there were no flip-flops and \\nshorts, because the dress code encourages \"glorifying God with \\nyour appearance.\" There were no iPod speakers perched on \\nanyone\\'s windows, shuffling from Beyonc\\xc3\\x88 to Coldplay, because \\niTunes lists are monitored and headphones are encouraged. There \\nwere no movie posters zeroing in on Scarlett Johansson\\'s cleavage, \\nand no live cleavage either, because girls are required to \\ncover their chests and, in any event, girls aren\\'t allowed in boys\\' \\ndorms. There was no impatient \"Mom, aren\\'t you guys going \\nsomewhere for dinner?\" and no sneaking around to figure out \\nwhere the rush parties were because at Patrick Henry there are \\nhardly ever parties, and drinking and dancing are not allowed. \\nThere were no heaps of clothes on the floor, or open bags of \\nCheetos. The only thing left blocking the hallway for any amount \\nof time was an ironing board-an ironing board, in a boys\\' dorm!\\nThroughout the year, school administrators conduct room \\nchecks to monitor cleanliness, but Derek did not really need that \\nincentive. Without any prodding, he set up his room like a Republican \\nFelix Unger. Above his desk he hung a signed Bush/ \\nCheney poster (\"To Mr. Archer, with deepest appreciation for \\nyour support\"), a promotional calendar from the Bush campaign, \\nand a postcard of Ronald Reagan (\"If we ever forget that we are \\none nation under God then we will be a nation gone under.\"). He \\nunpacked his favorite authors-Joshua Harris, Rush Limbaugh, \\nJohn Owen-and his prize possession, a Bible bound in black \\nleather that he got when he was twelve, its front cover so worn \\nfrom use that you have to divine the once-gold monogram with \\nyour finger, like the Shroud of Turin. Above his desk sat a woodblock \\nI\\'ve seen in many a Republican congressman\\'s office. It read: \\nTRUST ME.\\nAlthough Patrick Henry has rules about movie watching, \\nsome students keep secret stashes of DVDs in their bottom drawers, \\nbut Derek brought only one-Surf Ninjas, a martial arts spoof \\nabout two surfer brothers who discover they are long-lost princes \\nfrom a South China Sea island kingdom and use their newly discovered \\nspecial powers to overthrow an evil madman dictator. (\"I \\nenjoy the kind of humor it presents.\") He\\'d seen some movies in \\ntheaters, but not very many. \"You really have to be careful about \\nhow much you consume,\" he said. \"Watch one movie now and \\nagain with a bad message, and it will help you know what\\'s going \\non in the culture. But if you have a constant diet of that, that\\'s \\nwhere it gets destructive.\"\\nHe brought only a handful of CDs by contemporary Christian \\nartists such as Steven Curtis Chapman and Mercy Me-the kind \\nof syrupy Christian ballads about which the AC/DC-loving boys \\nat Leach\\'s had given him endless grief.\\n\"You don\\'t have to be careful when you listen to them,\" said \\nDonna.\\n\"Yes,\" Derek added, \"the gospel message is clear. Unlike some \\nsecular songs, which leave you with an empty feeling.\"\\nDerek indulged in excess in only one area, and this, too, he \\ncould trace back to his mom. His closet was bulging with clothes-suit \\npants and jackets and dress shirts and T-shirts and ties. But \\nthis display was not exactly what it seemed. These were hand-me-downs, \\ncollected from an aunt \"with fashionable inklings\" and \\nvarious church-run thrift stores. And while most teenage boys \\nmight find it annoying to be sent to school with plaid vests and suit \\njackets to \"grow into\" and dozens of shirts and ties collected from \\nchurch sales, Derek did not see it this way. To him, it was an embarrassment \\nof riches, so much so that he decided to bring it up \\nwith his mom.\\n\"I feel it\\'s a bit flashy, if you will,\" he said. \"I mean, you don\\'t \\nhave to wear something different every single day,\" he added, in a \\ntone that from him counted as defiance.\\n\"Well, I\\'m glad you don\\'t have a lack,\" she said. \"It\\'s better \\nnot to wear the same thing over and over. Girls notice that kind \\nof thing-that kind of lack of hygiene-more than guys.\"\\nOutside, the kids were comparing schedules-something \\nnew for homeschoolers used to learning at their family\\'s pace. \\nOver and over they recited the freshman routine-\"Latin, History, \\nLogic, Lit\"-a litany meant to calm them down. Derek had \\nbeen warned that students at Patrick Henry \"study, like, fifteen \\nhours a day,\" that they stay up all night or wake up at 4 A.M. and \\nare generally tightly wound and type A, much more so than he is. \\nHe was pretty sure he could keep up, but some other freshmen \\nalready seemed on the verge of snapping under the pressure.\\n\"I\\'ve been planning my classes for the last year, and now the \\nschedule\\'s not going to work,\" said one girl with a very tight \\nponytail, emerging from a meeting with her adviser.\\nHomeschoolers are not the most obvious raw material for a \\ncollege whose main mission is to train a new generation of Christian \\npoliticians. Politics, after all, is the most chaotic and social \\nof professions, and many students arrive at Patrick Henry having \\nnever shared a classroom with anyone other than their siblings. In \\nconservative circles, however, homeschoolers are considered to be \\nsomething of an elite group-rough around the edges but pure in \\ntheir focus, capacity for work, and ideological clarity. The kids \\nat Patrick Henry were raised advocating for the rights of homeschoolers; \\nduring orientation week, they shared stories of lobbying \\ncongressmen sympathetic to their cause or volunteering for \\ncampaigns. Most homeschoolers take field trips to the statehouse \\nthe way public school kids visit the zoo or the pumpkin patch.\\nTheir parents raised them tenderly, not with the intention of \\nsheltering them forever, but of grooming them for their ultimate \\nmission: to \"shape the culture and take back the nation.\" It\\'s a \\nphrase repeated in homeschooling circles like a prayer, or a chant, \\nor a company slogan. It shows up in homeschoolers\\' textbooks \\nand essays and church youth groups; their parents whisper it in \\ntheir ears like a secret destiny: There\\'s a world out there, a lost and \\nfallen world, and you alone can rescue it. Derek said it to a reporter \\nwho profiled him in the Akron Beacon Journal during his senior year \\nof high school. His father, Mark Archer, read Deuteronomy to \\nhim and explained how Moses never got to enter the Promised \\nLand; it\\'s the young Joshua who would lead the way to salvation.\\n\"If there\\'s any hope in this country, it\\'s from you kids,\" his dad \\ntold him. \"Morally, there is so much bad going on in this country. \\nIt will be you kids coming out of the homeschooling movement, \\nyour generation, who will do it.\"\\n\"Homeschooling does give a hope,\" his mother said, more \\ngently.\\nAt school the upperclassmen echoed their parent\\'s voices: \\n\"We\\'re the salt of the earth and it\\'s no good if the salt is kept in a \\nshaker,\" said Matthew du Mee, one of the school\\'s star graduates.\\n\"It\\'s like training knights,\" said a junior. \"We wear thick armor \\nto make the battle easier. We\\'re not saying we\\'re closer to \\nHeaven, but we go above and beyond the call of duty.\"\\nThe world out there, this enemy, was something the freshmen \\nhad seen only in bits and pieces-at summer jobs at 7-Elevens, \\nplaying sports at the local high school, or while changing channels. \\nTheir parents might have told them horror stories of drugs \\nand date rape and gay-pride parades, but most of them could \\nhardly imagine what those things might look like. But the Patrick \\nHenry freshmen, like nerdy teenage boys everywhere, loved science \\nfiction and its cinematic equivalent-Star Wars and Star Trek \\nand Ender\\'s Game and Surf Ninjas-stories in which a race of morally \\nand intellectually superior boys must leave their childhood home \\nprematurely to go fight enemies who want to destroy an already-mostly-destroyed \\nnation. And the boys always won in the end. \\nSubstitute Hillary Clinton for Darth Vader or the Klingons, and \\ntheir destiny suddenly made sense to them.\\nCampus in the first few days of orientation week felt like Jedi \\nAcademy or Battle School in the Belt or Hogwarts School of \\nWitchcraft and Wizardry (if they\\'d been allowed to read Harry \\nPotter). The boys were suddenly faced with an army of other \\nChosen Ones just like them, and they found it discomfiting. \\nThey knew the adults around them were looking for the next \\nNapoleon, the next Alexander, or at the very least the next Antonin \\nScalia, and they wanted to be It. At the endless series of \\nlunches and dinners under the big white tent, they sized each \\nother up, jockeying for position, and flexing their muscles in \\ncrude and awkward ways. They bragged about their special \\npowers in ways that they would cringe to remember a couple of \\nmonths later.\\nExcerpted from God\\'s Harvard by Hanna Rosin Copyright \\xc2\\xa9 2007 by Hanna Rosin.

But for all the sniping from adults who resent this territorial invasion, the onslaught shows no sign of letting up. In fact, one of its latest flash points is the local bar.\\nWhen the owners of Union Hall \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a moody, dark-paneled bar and brunch spot in Park Slope, Brooklyn \\xe2\\x80\\x94 recently posted a sign that read \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPlease, No Strollers\\xe2\\x80\\x9d under another one reading \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo One Under 21 Admitted,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d they did not see it as a declaration of war with the neighborhood\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sizable population of young parents.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe word gets out that this is a place for baby buggies to go, we end up with 8 to 10 strollers, or 15,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Jim Carden, an owner. He explained that the goal was simply to make sure that the preferred transportation for toddlers of the stay-at-home parents who had adopted the lounge as an afternoon hangout would not crowd out the regular patrons.\\nPerhaps he underestimated the neighborhood\\xe2\\x80\\x99s vocal and proactive parents. Local parenting blogs were soon bristling with denunciations.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis was a perfect winter moms\\xe2\\x80\\x99 group place for those of us with infants going stir-crazy,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d wrote one woman on onlytheblogknowsbrooklyn.com, wondering testily why local mothers could not at least drop in for \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca beer once a week when it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not crowded.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nOf course, the practice of bringing babies and young children to bars is hardly exclusive to Park Slope. The issue has been debated in online message boards in cities like Minneapolis, Philadelphia and Washington.\\nA woman in Boston, recently posting to yelp.com, a national, user-generated city-guide site, seemed appalled to see a 7-year-old next to her at a bar. (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere were cubes, crayons and candy on top of the bar,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she wrote. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDoes anyone else think there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s something wrong with that?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d)\\nIn England, the JD Wetherspoon chain of pubs recently implemented a rule making sure that parents who bring young children not only eat a meal, but stay for no more than two rounds. After a recent smoking ban, more families have been bringing children to pubs, and a spokesman for the chain was quoted by the BBC as saying, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOnce the children have had their meal, we can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see a reason why they should still be in the pub.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nIn New York, too, the smoking ban has altered the bar\\xe2\\x80\\x99s image. No longer a den of adult sin, the local tavern is now seen as an attractive option for afternoon gatherings among parents. (Neither New York state nor city law forbids minors in bars, although state regulations say children under 16 must be accompanied by an adult, a State Liquor Authority spokesman said.)\\nIt makes extra sense, parents said, in Park Slope, where the demarcation between generations has blurred \\xe2\\x80\\x94 in Brooklyn, hoodies and skateboard sneakers constitute a uniform for parents as well as their 5-year-olds.\\nWhile critics of bringing children to bars are vocal, some parents have embraced the habit with gusto. In recent years, mothers in Manhattan and in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, gathered for Wednesday afternoon cocktail mixers called Tots and Tonic. One former attendee, Christen Clifford, a writer and actress who now lives in Jackson Heights, Queens, proudly recalled breast-feeding her son, Felix, at the bar before ordering a martini.\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s one way of denying that your youthful exploits come with a shelf life, she acknowledged. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPsychologically, you feel like, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Oh, my life hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t changed that much,\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xc2\\xa0\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9calthough of course it completely has.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nNeal Pollack, the author of the book \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAlternadad,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said that Generation X parents \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the types who sport gray whiskers in their beards and Vampire Weekend downloads on their iPods \\xe2\\x80\\x94 \\xe2\\x80\\x9cvalue lifestyle above most things.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a bad thing that people want to continue a semblance of their pre-parenthood lifestyle,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Pollack, who lives in Los Angeles. Going to rock shows and bars, he added, is \\xe2\\x80\\x9cjust what their lives were.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nIn a sense, Park Slope is the perfect testing ground for the practice of extreme generational commingling at the local saloon. It is a neighborhood of young parents, of the sort who consider themselves laid back enough that they can carve out some time to knock back a few with junior.\\nBesides, many like to think of the neighborhood, with its elegant town houses and literary air, as London or Dublin in miniature. In those cities, the pub often doubles as a community center.\\nDawn D\\xe2\\x80\\x99Arcy, the manager of the Gate, a bar in Park Slope that routinely sees groups of parents and children drop by during the afternoon, agreed, saying that the Gate was \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmodeled on an Irish pub.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is a place where people bring dogs in, this is a \\xe2\\x80\\x98local,\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xc2\\xa0\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFamilies are a part of that.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nBut Park Slope being what it is, the Union Hall debate soon took on metaphorical dimensions. This, after all, is a place where the stroller serves as a symbol: to parents, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a token of shared purpose in what many consider a child-rearing Eden; to critics, often artfully scruffy singles who feel crowded out by more affluent stroller-pushers, it connotes relentless gentrification.\\nThe founders of a local blog, takebacktheisland.wordpress.com, which purports to advocate the rights of the childless, were not alone among bloggers who interpreted Union Hall\\xe2\\x80\\x99s gesture as a line in the sand.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe salute Union Hall for following our lead and sticking up for the rights of childless adults who don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to deal with someone\\xe2\\x80\\x99s loud, crying infant when they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re trying to relax and have a drink,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said one of the site\\xe2\\x80\\x99s founders, (both women in their 20s), who uses the screen-name Ruby Stoneheart, in an e-mail response to this reporter\\xe2\\x80\\x99s question about the dispute.\\nThe move by Union Hall is not the first time a local business invited censure by taking on the stroller class. Last year, the two-story Barnes & Noble on Seventh Avenue posted a sign restricting strollers to a designated area on its ground floor; the sign was removed after a neighborhood outcry. In 2005, a bartender at the Patio Lounge, a bar on Fifth Avenue, posted a sign \\xe2\\x80\\x94 still known as the infamous \\xe2\\x80\\x9cStroller Manifesto\\xe2\\x80\\x9d on local parents\\xe2\\x80\\x99 blogs \\xe2\\x80\\x94 that asked, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat is it with people bringing their kids into bars?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nTo members of a previous generation, as well as to the proprietors of Union Hall, it would seem like a valid question. Mr. Carden insisted the ban was pragmatic, not dogmatic. He explained that Union Hall contains any number of potential child-hazards that could constitute a liability for the owners \\xe2\\x80\\x94 an open staircase, a full-size boccie court involving \\xe2\\x80\\x9chard balls thrown around.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSometimes there are broken glasses,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he added. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is a bar.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n', 'WHEN Englishmen in 1816 gave the area midway between Williamsburg, Brooklyn, and Jamaica, Queens, the rather uncreative name of Middle Village, it seemed they ensured that it would largely stay off people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s maps.\\nNot that the residents are complaining.  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a very consistent neighborhood,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Gary Giordano, who has been district manager of the community board since 1989. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou move here, you know what it\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll look like in 10, 15, 20 years. You raise your kids here. And your kids raise your grandkids here.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nSince a housing boom in the 1920s, this two-square-mile pocket of Queens  \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the generally accepted boundaries are the Long Island Expressway, Cooper Avenue, the huge Mount Olivet Cemetery and Woodhaven Boulevard  \\xe2\\x80\\x94 has enjoyed the kind of lifestyle one might expect in suburbia farther afield.\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a neighborhood where the mothers pushing strollers through the various parks are actually strolling. No texting. No ramping up cardio. Nary an iPod in sight. The lack of a Whole Foods or Citarella is made up for by a scattershot assortment of specialty stores: bakers, butchers and grocers run less by district managers and more by local shopkeepers who know your name and your children\\xe2\\x80\\x99s names.\\nThe 2000 census population of 28,984 showed just a three-person increase over the 1990 population. Ethnically, Middle Village is about a third Italian, 14 percent Irish, 10 percent German and 7 percent Polish. All that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s left of its English heritage  are the names of its streets and the small but lavish gardens.\\nAmong the newcomers are Carol Whelan and her brother Alan, who paid $777,000 for their two-family home a few months ago. They came from Ireland, and moved in along with Mr. Whelan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s stepson, 12, and Ms. Whelan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s daughter, 14, finding in Middle Village a less crowded feeling than in  nearby Ridgewood, Glendale or Maspeth.\\nManhattan officials talked in recent years of a freight tunnel under New York Harbor that would spill out into Middle Village, followed by a major cargo hub, with many big-rig trucks every day.  But residents have been deft in taking evasive action.\\nAs Robert Holden of the often-fierce Juniper Park Civic Association put it: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDevelopment and construction and big projects, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s considered progress in some neighborhoods. Not here.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nUltimately, it is unclear whether the plan died because of local opposition or complications with federal financing. But Mr. Holden is happy to credit locals.  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re solid, friendly blue-collar people,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Holden said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe backbone of the city, we call ourselves.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nMr. Holden\\xe2\\x80\\x99s group has also had a strong hand in various neighborhood rezoning efforts,  including the addition of so-called textural zones, which, since 2005, have sought to ensure that  multifamily homes do not predominate. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the kind of coziness that Mr. Holden, 56, says keeps his  23-year-old daughter pining for home, all the way from her sixth-floor walk-up on 79th Street in Manhattan, just off the F.D.R. Drive.\\nWHAT YOU\\xe2\\x80\\x99LL FIND\\nYes, Queens in general is packed with the squat single-family homes of the sort that were made famous by Archie and Edith Bunker of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAll in the Family\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in the 1970s, and George Costanza\\xe2\\x80\\x99s parents in \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSeinfeld\\xe2\\x80\\x9d 20 years later. But the houses here are often embellished as mini-manors. Because so many people live their whole lives in the neighborhood, their homes are sometimes passed between generations, avoiding the marketplace entirely.\\nOne property on 84th Street, for example, is on the market for the first time since 1925; it still has its original stained-glass windows and cathedral ceilings from the era.\\nAs for the commercial parts of the neighborhood, they have been gaining in sophistication. Toyo, a Japanese restaurant, and Uvarara, a wine bar, recently opened on Metropolitan Avenue, the main business strip (outside of the area\\xe2\\x80\\x99s two large malls). And then there is C\\xe2\\x80\\x99Spa, which offers decidedly Manhattanite metrosexual treatments like facials and waxings for men.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cEveryone lives close to the parks here,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Luis Tavera, a hospital union worker whose recent move here was prompted by his wife\\xe2\\x80\\x99s new teaching job. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s great after spending the day in the thick of Manhattan. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve all got the great Juniper Valley Park, and I dare say that all the surrounding cemeteries basically make you feel like you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re in a park anyway.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d When you ride along the edge of a cemetery on the Q54 bus down Metropolitan Avenue, he joked, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe neighbors are quiet here.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nWHAT YOU\\xe2\\x80\\x99LL PAY\\nPrices have declined almost 10 percent in the last year, said Salvatore Crifasi, 53, president of Crifasi Real Estate, a local resident who met his wife, Catherine, by Juniper Valley Park when he was 17 and she was 15.\\nMost single-family properties sell for $500,000 to $700,000, with some new condominiums near the M line subway terminal going for $300,000 to $400,000.\\nMultifamilies often have  scant parking (because they have gone up where single-family homes used to be). They run from around $400,000, for older properties, to the million-dollar mark for new construction.\\nMr. Crifasi, who has been selling real estate in Middle Village since 1974, said about two-thirds of the buyers and sellers were \\xe2\\x80\\x9clocals playing musical chairs in their hometown, none of these yipsters who have been moving into places like Astoria or Williamsburg.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nThere are 97 one-, two- and three-family homes on the market, 44 of which are single-family; an additional 24 condos are for sale as well, Mr. Crifasi said.\\nTwo-family homes, like the Whelans\\xe2\\x80\\x99, are a hot commodity  \\xe2\\x80\\x94  especially because renting out half of a home helps finances in these troubled times. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFour out of five calls I get are asking for two-family homes,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Alex Benisatto, a local associate with Coldwell Banker.\\nLast year, 199 homes spent time on the market and 141 sold,  Mr. Crifasi said. The average sale price was $592,575; average time on the market was 84 days. That compares with 106 homes on the market so far this year, with 37 closing after an average of 93 days, for an average price of $582,196.\\nTHE COMMUTE\\nIn July, the Q54 was rerouted to add a stop at the Shops at Atlas Park (which opened in 2006 and is named after the bodybuilder Charles Atlas, who was a Middle Villager). That line also makes a stop at the M station, which terminates at Metropolitan Avenue. This means no sardine-can experiences as you board the train into Manhattan. It takes about 30 minutes to get to Midtown. The M, which now ends downtown, is to be extended through Brooklyn, to the DeKalb and Atlantic Avenue stations and almost to Coney Island.\\nWHAT TO DO\\nThe Middle Village Chamber of Commerce\\xe2\\x80\\x99s third annual Community Day was Sept. 7. About 5,000 residents attended the festivities in Juniper Valley Park, for free amusement rides, popcorn, soda and other  treats.\\nParents often let their children play in the fountains at Atlas Park. In the winter months, those same children may very well be taken to the hockey rink now available at Juniper Valley Park.\\nLucy Accardo, who is involved in a group she called Mom\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Club, says mothers are tightly knit and regularly meet up at the local New York Sports Club or Borders bookstore (where employees hold readings for children).\\nMrs. Accardo and her husband, Claudio, have four children, ages 3, 6, 7 and 9. She also runs a parenting health and wellness business via the Web, mykidsaremyboss.com. She says she likes Middle Village\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tranquil pace. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI grew up in Astoria, lived there forever and still never really got to know my neighbors, because they were always moving in or out,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd it was always changing and growing, trying to be a mini-Manhattan. Middle Village is the opposite of that. I take the stroller to pick up my kids after school and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m actually pushing the stroller down the street, not jamming it into the car.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nTHE SCHOOLS\\nThere are three public elementaries: Nos. 128, 49 and 87.  Public School 128 recently switched from a kindergarten-through-Grade 5 setup to encompass Grades 6, 7 and 8.\\nHigh school students go to Grover Cleveland, Forest Hills or Newtown. According to Andrew Jacob of the city Education Department, Forest Hills had the best SAT averages last year: 458 in reading, 486 in math and 454 in writing, versus 488, 504 and 481 statewide. Grover Cleveland\\xe2\\x80\\x99s averages were 399, 434 and 398; Newtown\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 387, 439 and 384.\\nAmong parochial schools are Our Lady of Hope and St. Margaret\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, both teaching kindergarten through eighth grade, and Christ the King High School, which has a strong basketball team.\\nTHE HISTORY\\nThe cemeteries have been a mainstay since the 19th century, when the Catholic and Lutheran churches bought farmland. In 1915, Juniper Swamp was filled in to become Juniper Valley Park. The area has also had Mafia connections: Anthony Aiello and Vincent Ganci both lived here; John Gotti and Lucky Luciano are buried at St. John\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Cemetery.\\n', '', '', 'MODELED on the protests and celebrations that erupt on the National Mall, Jean Shin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s latest installation \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a roiling, shoulder-to-shoulder crowd in miniature \\xe2\\x80\\x94 will carpet a 45-foot-long rectangular space at the Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington beginning May 1. The figures will be gleaming trophies, stripped of their sports paraphernalia and refashioned with new props into janitors, cashiers, mailmen and other unsung laborers, now pushing their strollers or swinging their hammers in exalted form.\\nMs. Shin, who was commissioned by the museum to create the installation, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cEveryday Monuments,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as part of her exhibition \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCommon Threads,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was inspired by Washington as a city planned around its heroic monuments. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI thought of these trophies as a way to bring the monumentality to a more intimate level,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Ms. Shin, 37, an artist known for her vast accumulations of singular castoff objects \\xe2\\x80\\x94 old clothing, empty prescription bottles, losing lottery tickets \\xe2\\x80\\x94 which she transforms into arresting installations that loosely reflect the people who once used the items.\\nFor \\xe2\\x80\\x9cEveryday Monuments,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d which will be on view through July 26, she gathered donations of more than 2,000 trophies with the help of the Smithsonian and local donors who included parents of students at Walt Whitman High School in Bethesda, Md., which she attended after her family moved from South Korea when she was 6. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe trophies can have a second life and be updated to represent all the people who maybe never won trophies or decided not to be sports stars but live their lives through work,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said.\\nWhen Ms. Shin first conceived of the piece a couple of years ago, she was thinking of grand moments on the National Mall like the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.\\xe2\\x80\\x99s historic speech there and the Million Man March, but she could never have foreseen the flooding of people into the space for President Obama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s inauguration. Joanna Marsh, curator of the exhibition, considers it serendipity.  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was wonderful to see that actualized just as the piece was coming together, and it will be so fresh in people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s minds when they see the work,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said, adding that the exhibition will also include seven other large-scale installations Ms. Shin has created since 2000.\\nOn a recent morning at her small studio in Brooklyn, filled with a team of assistants meticulously attaching tiny cast mops, paint rollers, cash registers and computers to hundreds of trophies, Ms. Shin described watching her parents, who had both been professors in Seoul, struggle with discrimination and menial jobs when they moved to the Washington area, where they eventually owned a supermarket and liquor store. For a child the adjustment was easier. In high school she was encouraged to pursue painting seriously, and in her senior year in 1990 she entered the national Presidential Scholars in the Arts competition and won a full scholarship to the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, her own trophy of sorts.\\nAfter receiving her B.F.A. in painting in 1994, she went on at Pratt to get a master\\xe2\\x80\\x99s degree in art history and criticism and then took a day job at the Whitney Museum as a curatorial assistant. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy studio practice really shifted by studying art history and criticism,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Ms. Shin, who began questioning her reasons for making figurative painting and struggled to find a new direction and choice of materials.\\nOne day it occurred to the petite Ms. Shin as she was organizing her cluttered Williamsburg apartment that all the cuffs of fabric that she had trimmed from the bottom of her pants were the same size. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t fit fashion\\xe2\\x80\\x99s standard by exactly two-and-a-half inches,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFashion is so much about these ideals. I began to think about how using the leftover pant legs could be personal and physical as well as speak to our collective desires.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nShe canvassed alterations shops and found people who agreed to save their pant-leg scraps for her. Gathering hundreds of these cylindrical forms, Ms. Shin dipped them in wax to make them stiff. Then, for a group show at Gen Art in New York in 1998, she installed a roughly 12-by-12-foot cityscape of cuffs across the floor, suggesting a population that didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t measure up. Called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAlterations\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and purchased by the collector Peter Norton, the piece also alluded to the largely Asian immigrant work force that does most of the tailoring jobs in New York.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s become a really important part of my work,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said of the community collaboration required for \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAlterations,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgoing up to total strangers and somehow implicating myself in the objects of their lives. Any material I get is the beginning of a conversation and a relationship.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nMs. Shin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s earlier work was defined by her use of clothing as surrogates for people. But since 2004, when she had her first solo show, at the Frederieke Taylor Gallery in New York, Ms. Shin has branched out more to nonfabric materials that still have a physical relationship to the body. For \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTEXTile,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d made in 2006 in collaboration with the Fabric Workshop and Museum in Philadelphia, she took apart old computer keyboards to illuminate how these objects, touched by rote with our fingertips, project our thoughts out into the world. More than 22,000 key caps, spelling out all the e-mail messages between the artist and the Fabric Workshop about the making of the artwork, were embedded into a 20-foot-long fabric scroll.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cChemical Balance,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d also part of the Smithsonian show, alludes to how we change the chemistry of our bodies through prescription drugs. Ms. Shin gathered empty orange pill bottles and assembled them into towering arrangements that appear to grow out of the floor or dangle from the ceiling. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAny organic structure that we see in nature bonds together and then falls apart for its own purposes of growth and decay,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Ms. Shin, who is interested in mirroring society\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dependence on these drugs.\\nShe has very particular criteria for the salvaged materials she uses in her work: that something is \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccast off from a person\\xe2\\x80\\x99s life because its desirability and usefulness are questioned, that it in some way archives a personal history but also can speak to larger issues going on in our culture.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd then,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she added, \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccan I deconstruct it and make it new?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nHer recently completed mosaic, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCeladon Remnants,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d commissioned by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Arts for Transit program and installed along the outdoor stairwell of a Long Island Rail Road station in a densely populated Korean-American community in Queens, was inspired by the elegance and fragility of celadon pottery commonly found in Korean homes. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a celebrated moment in history when Koreans perfected this ceramic that people take lots of pride in,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said.\\nFor the project Ms. Shin traveled to Icheon, just outside Seoul, and persuaded the government to donate a vast landscape of broken pottery from outside one of the major kilns.\\nShe then used her budget for materials to ship the three tons of shards back to the United States, where she worked with a fabricator to reconstitute the fragments into large, partial silhouettes showing just enough of the curves to suggest vases but also evoking the abstract shapes of Ellsworth Kelly. Literally and metaphorically she reunited something broken in Korea in a new form in America.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFor me,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe greater only happens by the accumulation of many, one piece at a time.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n', 'MODIIN ILLIT, West Bank \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Seen from afar, this fast-growing settlement embodies everything that the Obama administration wants to address through its demand for a freeze on settlement building: it sits on land captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war and, with 45,000 residents and 60 births a week, it is the largest and fastest-growing Jewish community in the West Bank.\\nIf, as is widely believed abroad, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnatural growth\\xe2\\x80\\x9d by Israeli settlers is blocking the creation of a viable Palestinian state, this community should show why.\\nBut appearances are deceiving. Modiin Illit and its sister community, Beitar Illit, are entirely ultra-Orthodox, a world apart, one of strict religious observance and study. They offer surprising potential for compromise.\\nUnlike settlers who believe they are continuing the historic Zionist mission of reclaiming the Jewish homeland, most ultra-Orthodox do not consider themselves settlers or Zionists and express no commitment to being in the West Bank, so their growth in these settlement towns, situated just inside the pre-1967 boundary, could be redirected westward to within Israel.\\nTheir location also means it may be possible, in negotiations about a future Palestinian state, to redraw the boundary so the settlements are inside Israel, with little land lost to the Palestinians. And the two towns alone account for half of all settler growth, so if removed from the equation, the larger settler challenge takes on more manageable proportions.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf I thought this was a settlement, I would never have come here,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Yaakov Guterman, 40, the mayor of Modiin Illit and a grandfather of three, his Orthodox fringes hanging from his belt, his side locks curled behind his ears. Asked about the prospect of a Palestinian state rising one day on his town line, he said: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe will go along with what the world wants. We have gone through the Holocaust and know what it means to have the world against us. The Torah says a man needs to know his place.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nWhether or not Mr. Guterman will be as pliant as he says, Middle East peace negotiators on all sides \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Israeli, Palestinian and American \\xe2\\x80\\x94 have long viewed small border adjustments and land swaps as key to a deal that would include a solution to the hundreds of thousands of Jews who have settled in the West Bank over the past four decades.\\nThis week, three senior American officials will be in Jerusalem for talks that will include settlements:  the Middle East envoy, George J. Mitchell; the White House Middle East adviser, Dennis Ross; and the national security adviser, Gen. James Jones. Secretary of Defense Robert  M. Gates will also be in talks in Jerusalem.\\nBreak With Settler Movement  \\nThe ultra-Orthodox inhabitants often express contempt for the settler movement, with its vows never to move. The people here, who shun most aspects of modernity, came for three reasons: they needed affordable housing no longer available in and around Jerusalem or Tel Aviv; they were rejected by other Israeli cities as too cult-like; and officials wanted their presence to broaden Israel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s narrow border.\\nYet they are lumped with everyone else. The settler movement  and the Israeli government point to ultra-Orthodox settlements, with their large and ever-increasing families, to argue that there is no way to stop \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnatural growth\\xe2\\x80\\x9d without imposing acute human suffering. Those seeking a freeze use the settlements as evidence that growth is so out of control that drastic action must be taken. More broadly, opponents say the settlements violate international law, legitimize force by armed messianic Jews and ruin the chance of establishing a viable Palestinian state.\\nBut even those who strongly favor a complete freeze acknowledge that the annual settler growth rates of 5 and 6 percent owe a great deal to these two towns that have little to do with the broader settler enterprise.\\nDror Etkes of Yesh Din, an antisettlement group in Israel, noted that half of all construction in West Bank settlements was taking place in these two ultra-Orthodox communities, adding that given their location next to the boundary, it was highly likely they would be in Israel in a future deal through a redrawn border. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFrom a purely geographic point of view, construction there is not as destructive as elsewhere,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said.\\nBut he  does not want building to continue in Modiin Illit or Beitar Illit without a deal for a Palestinian state, nor does he mean to imply that these settlements have been a benign force. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLand has been taken from Palestinians, in some cases from private landowners, for the building in these settlements, and there are many other issues like sewage flow into Palestinian villages that must be addressed,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Etkes said.\\nSettler leaders reject any distinction. The fact that the ultra-Orthodox came to the West Bank to solve their housing problems is \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccompletely O.K. with me,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Dani Dayan, chairman of the Yesha Council, the settlers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 political umbrella group. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey are an integral part of our endeavor and our achievement.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n The Palestinian View \\nBut even in Bilin, the Palestinian village that abuts Modiin Illit and has become a symbol of Palestinian resistance against Israel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s West Bank separation barrier, the settlers over the fence are viewed as different from the Jewish nationalists in, say, Hebron.\\nAbedallah Abu Rahma, a teacher from a farming family and a leading activist in the village, pointed toward the settler high-rise buildings visible across the valley from his living room window and said: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey tell us, \\xe2\\x80\\x98We are poor, the apartments here are cheaper and we did not know it was a settlement.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Many told us, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Give us our money back and we will leave.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xc2\\xa0\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nThe Palestinians, who hold weekly demonstrations against the barrier, have even joined forces with some of the settlers. Two years ago, Bilin won a major Supreme Court case  that forced a change in the route of the barrier, and some of the documents the victorious villagers used, Mr. Abu Rahma said, had been secretly passed to them by ultra-Orthodox settlers feuding with their own municipal leaders.\\nStill, none of that lessens the harm to the villagers caused by the very existence of Modiin Illit and the contest over its land. Mr. Abu Rahma said he would respect any agreement reached between the Palestinian leadership and Israel, including one that had  Modiin Illit standing in Israel. But noting the village\\xe2\\x80\\x99s reliance on agriculture, its own housing needs and the settlement\\xe2\\x80\\x99s encroachment on Bilin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s territory, he insisted, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe need our land.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nMoreover, protecting the settlements from attack has meant construction of numerous barriers, checkpoints and bypass roads that impair economic development and disrupt daily life.\\nAcross the West Bank and excluding East Jerusalem, there are nearly 300,000 settlers living on scores of settlements among 2.3 million Palestinians. And while some say they will fight to stay put, a third are the reluctant ultra-Orthodox, known in Israel as Haredim, Hebrew for the fearful ones, or those who tremble in awe of God.\\nThey believe it important to live in the land of Israel, because certain commandments can be performed only here. But some Haredim actively reject the formation of a Jewish state before the arrival of the Messiah, while others are ambivalent. They also say that protecting life trumps holding territory. Very few serve in the military because the ultra-Orthodox say they do more good for the nation by studying the Torah and praying than fighting.\\nUntil his death in 2001, Rabbi Eliezer Schach  was the religious authority of the  Haredim of European origin. He opposed building Jewish settlements that extended over the 1967 line into territory Israel seized in the war, once calling them \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca blatant attempt to provoke the international community\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and complaining that they endangered Jewish lives. In fact, when first offered housing for his followers in Beitar Illit, he took it as an insult, according to Yitzchak Pindrus, a former mayor of the settlement.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOur people live around their families and rabbis, and they were terrified of the idea,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Pindrus recalled. But with thousands of new couples marrying every year, and the traditional ultra-Orthodox communities expensive and crowded, the Haredim needed homes.\\nBecause few ultra-Orthodox men work, because on average their families have eight children and because they do not integrate easily into the larger community, Teddy Kollek, who was  mayor of Jerusalem in the late 1980s, wanted to keep down their numbers. Other cities rejected them. Yitzhak Rabin,  as both defense minister and then prime minister,  championed the creation of large settlements around Jerusalem to fortify Israel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hold on the capital, in line with his Labor Party\\xe2\\x80\\x99s strategic plan, so he and the Haredim struck a deal for Beitar Illit in the early 1990s.\\nFor those wanting to remain closer to longstanding Haredi communities in the center of the country, Modiin Illit was an alternative. Private Israeli developers bought tracts of Palestinian land  as its base, although the legitimacy of those sales has been challenged. Mr. Guterman, the mayor,  said Mr. Rabin \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgave his blessing to the city,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d telling Rabbi Schach\\xe2\\x80\\x99s disciples that its strategic location on the first rise above Israel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s international airport guaranteed that it would not be given back.\\nThere are smaller pockets of Haredi settlement deeper in the West Bank, where the arm\\xe2\\x80\\x99s-length attitude toward Zionist settlement has shifted toward a more distinctly right-wing ideology. Zvi Kastelanitz, of the Immanuel settlement, who produces silver-inlaid Jewish handicrafts, for example, said he had no objection to two states for two peoples, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut not here.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Still, the Haredi settlers even there remain distinct. After Palestinians ambushed two buses on the road to Immanuel, southwest of Nablus, in 2001 and 2002, killing a total of 20 people, the Haredi settlers did not react like their nationalist counterparts, defiantly setting up another settlement outpost. Instead, about a third of Immanuel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 4,000 residents left.\\nShunning Secular World \\nThe Haredi world is all about being together and apart from secular temptations, an intricate patchwork of groups with allegiances to different rabbinic dynasties and courts. In the new cities, Haredi rules apply. At the entrance to Beitar Illit, a sign warns visitors to dress modestly. The streets are all named for rabbis and sages from Poland to Yemen. There is Internet access, officially intended for professional use only. Televisions are allowed, but nobody admits to having one. And there is poverty: about 40 percent of wives support their large families because their husbands do not work. There are few cars, lots of buses and baby strollers.\\nDov Fromowitz, a father of nine who moved  to Beitar Illit from the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn 12 years ago, runs a central charity fund that collects money from better-off residents and distributes it to the poor, while connecting them with other social welfare services outside the settlement. He says he has 1,200 needy families on his books.\\nWithout most Israelis noticing, Modiin Illit and Beitar Illit have turned into the Haredi towns of the future, cleaner and saner versions of their often decrepit and densely packed neighborhoods elsewhere. They contain open space, even some greenery, and apartments with lots of bedrooms. Their young are shielded from secular Israel, and secular Israelis never see them, thereby reducing the tensions found in Jerusalem over driving on the Sabbath and sexy advertising at bus stops.\\nThe Question of Coexistence \\nEven if the ultra-Orthodox appear to be less ideologically committed to the West Bank, the longer they live here, the more invested some have become.\\nIn Modiin Illit, Mayor Guterman has ambitions to build what he calls \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe largest Haredi residential community in Israel.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Over the past three years, he has set up a business center that he considers the wave of the future. Now 1,000 women, mostly mothers in their 20s, sit at work stations providing phone services to Israeli credit card clients and paralegal research for real estate businesses in the United States. It is outsourcing that seeks to take advantage of the educational level and work ethic of Haredi women.\\nThe question of coexistence with Palestinians hovers, however. In Beitar Illit, farmers from the village of Husan enter daily in cars and on donkeys to work their lands in the valleys among the settlements\\xe2\\x80\\x99 built-up hills. The new mayor, Meir Rubinstein, is proud of the city\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cooperation with local Palestinians, whom he calls \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe neighbors.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe very much want there to be peace here,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe pray for it three times a day.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d But the question of peace at what price remains.\\nAvraham and Riva Guttman, who arrived in Beitar Illit 15 years ago from Toronto and have seven children, look out from their street at Palestinian villages. They believe strongly in living in the land of Israel, they say, and they are happy for the parks and space lacking in traditional Haredi areas of Israel. But they do not insist that it is there or nothing. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe are not here for political reasons,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Guttman said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNinety percent of the people are here for the affordability, not for ideology. Haredim don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t fight with Arabs.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nPerhaps not, but his wife, Riva, bristled at the idea of moving. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you told me to move elsewhere because Arabs needed a place to live, it would not sit quietly on my conscience,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am a Jew in the Jewish homeland.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nAnd increasingly, the Haredim have vested interests over the 1967 line. Yaron and Sara Simchovitch arrived in Beitar Illit from Jerusalem 13 years ago with a group led by their rabbi. The couple now have a thriving butcher shop.\\nYoseph Shilhav, an expert on the ultra-Orthodox at Bar-Ilan University, said that almost every Haredi family now had a member beyond the 1967 border, subtly shifting their attitudes about  settlement and withdrawal. The Haredim make up 10 percent of Israel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s population and are a fast-growing electoral force. The Chabad movement and Sephardic or Middle Eastern-origin Shas party have increasingly adopted the nationalist agenda.\\nThe rocket fire into Israel that resulted after its withdrawal from Gaza in 2005 has also taken its toll on Haredi views. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn general, Haredim are very practical people,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Pindrus, the former Beitar Illit mayor. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe are not right or left. If we get up in the morning and see that leaving Gaza means missiles, then no, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not leaving another centimeter.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He added, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe want to live, and our children not to blow up.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nStill, a surprising number do not oppose the establishment of a Palestinian state if safety can be guaranteed. Since housing is the No. 1 Haredi concern and they feel no need for it to be in the West Bank, redirecting the building of their new homes inside Israel could go a long way toward a solution.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf the Americans can convince us there will really be peace and we won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be living in fear of rockets, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll bring a recommendation to our rabbis,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Guterman, the mayor of Modiin Illit. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOur rabbis want peace. We are not against withdrawing from territory. But life is above all.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n', 'NEW YORK used to be  a second-string city when it came to coffee. No longer.\\nOver the last two years, more than 40 new cafes and coffee bars have joined a small, dedicated group of establishments where coffee making is treated like an art, or at least a high form of craft.\\nAt places like Bluebird Coffee Shop in the East Village, the espresso is so plush and bright that it tastes sweet on its own.\\nThe elaborate designs in the cappuccino\\xe2\\x80\\x99s foam at Third Rail Coffee in the West Village aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t just to show off, but are a sign that the barista properly steamed the milk so that it holds its form.\\nAt Abra\\xc3\\xa7o in the East Village, you can get drip coffee brewed by the cup, not drawn from an urn.\\nFor years New Yorkers had to look to places like Stumptown Coffee Roasters in Portland, Ore., or Blue Bottle Coffee in San Francisco for this kind of quality. Now both companies have opened roasters and coffee bars in New York. Four Barrel Coffee of San Francisco will be roasting here soon.\\nMeanwhile, some established cafes around the city have made moves toward roasting their own beans. Caf\\xc3\\xa9 Grumpy is already doing it, and Abra\\xc3\\xa7o will by the summer.\\nThis means that New Yorkers can now drink coffee that is made from some of the best beans available in the United States, freshly roasted in town.\\nThe difference between a cup of coffee from these new style coffee bars and what was available before is striking.\\nThese shops use only beans that have been roasted in the past 10 days (though some say two weeks is fine), so the flavors are still lively.\\nThe beans are ground to order for each cup. Certain coffee bars have a skyline of grinders: one for espresso, one for decaffeinated espresso, one for brewed coffee. If they offer more than one variety of espresso bean, that gets its own grinder, too.\\nMilk is steamed to order for each macchiato or latte. A telltale sign is an arsenal of smaller steam pitchers, instead of one big one.\\nAnd coffee bars reaching for the highest rung use only manual espresso machines run by baristas who, in the past three years, have been able to attend classes given by the leading roasting companies in the intricacies of these devices. Many chain stores are turning to automatic machines with preset levels for coffee, temperature and timing.\\nFor brewed coffee, there are French press pots, filter cones or machines like the Clover or Bunn\\xe2\\x80\\x99s new Trifecta.\\nSome of the obsessiveness may get a bit off-putting. Want an espresso to go at Ninth Street Espresso? Forget it. The baristas there believe it should be drunk immediately from a warm ceramic cup. Want a cappuccino made from single-origin beans at Kaffe 1668? Sorry, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be told, but milk would overpower the subtle flavors of the coffee. Wonder why the barista pulled and tossed out two shots of espresso before she served you yours? She was making sure it was perfect, the coffee evenly tamped, the water temperature ideal for the particular beans, the timing just right. (The best baristas will \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdial in\\xe2\\x80\\x9d throughout the day, tasting the espresso and adjusting the grind and dose.)\\nWant a double espresso? You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll have to buy two singles.\\nToday, most of the chains use about seven grams of ground coffee for a two-ounce shot. Espresso pods are filled with around five grams.\\nBaristas at the best places in town, like Bluebird Coffee Shop or Joe, tamp down between 19 and 21 grams. Often the espresso is even more concentrated because it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pulled \\xe2\\x80\\x9cshort,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d with less water, so that the final volume is a thick 1.5 to 2 ounces.\\nWith that much coffee \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and care \\xe2\\x80\\x94  put into each shot, baristas feel that a larger shot, with more water, would compromise the quality of the espresso.\\nThis awakening has led some unlikely businesses to offer serious, artful drinks. Saturdays Surf, a minimalist surf shop in SoHo, has a vintage la Marzocco machine next to the cash register. At Moomah, a children\\xe2\\x80\\x99s center in TriBeCa, parents can enjoy one of the city\\xe2\\x80\\x99s more artful cappuccinos.\\nEven restaurants, where coffee has long been an afterthought, are getting in on the act.\\nSuperior coffee, day after day: increasingly it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the rule in New York, not the exception.\\nHere are places in New York serving the best coffee. Included are 10 outstanding coffee bars (listed with an asterisk) that not only produce extraordinary coffee at the highest standards, but also do so with consistency, day after day. There are also coffee bars that serve particularly good drip coffee, restaurants with great coffee, coffee bars with nice baked goods and places to buy beans, all of which are noted on a map, here.\\nThe Best Coffee Places in Manhattan and Brooklyn\\n * ABRA\\xc3\\x87O There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s barely room enough for six standing adults, never mind the dozen or more who can crowd in during prime time.

Mr. Fortuna works for Google as a senior software engineer. Ms. Fortuna, a civil engineer, is employed by a consulting firm that is helping to renovate the 107-year-old Williamsburg Bridge.\\nBut finding a place to live in a big and sometimes unforgiving city proved daunting. Knowing little about New York and having few friends to whom they could turn for guidance, the Fortunas ended up in a prewar building on the Upper West Side in a studio that had been reconfigured as a cramped one-bedroom apartment.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was also a fourth-floor walk-up,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Ms. Fortuna recalled. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut the worst thing was that the building turned out to be infested with bedbugs. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d see them crawling on the mailboxes when I walked in the front door.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nThe fridge was so old that when the light burned out, replacement bulbs were no longer available. Trucks barreling down Columbus Avenue jolted the Fortunas awake at 5 in the morning. Occasionally they looked at other apartments, but with little success.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know anyone in the city who could give us advice,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Ms. Fortuna said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd that made it hard.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nOne day the following summer, the couple took the tram to Roosevelt Island, just to admire the view. They barely set foot on the island; they turned right around and went back to Manhattan. But the casual outing introduced them to a corner of the city that would ultimately offer an apartment and a community in which they would feel utterly at home. After their lease on the Upper West Side ran out, Roosevelt Island was their next stop.\\nThe couple\\xe2\\x80\\x99s first toehold there was an apartment in a newish high-rise. It was also a 10-minute walk from the island\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lone subway stop. Finding the bus service erratic, they traveled to and from the subway by bike, but  that proved less fun as winter approached and even worse when it rained. Still, they savored the pace and friendliness of island life.\\nThey especially relished the walkway that runs along the island\\xe2\\x80\\x99s western rim, a popular route along which strollers and bench sitters could admire the Manhattan skyline while perched beside the water.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou see the same people day after day,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Ms. Fortuna said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey say hi. You say hello. It felt really good. We didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know many people in New York. But thanks partly to this street, we got to know people here.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nTwo years after they settled on the island and now both 29, they lucked out further when a two-bedroom condominium became available in Riverwalk Court, a brand-new high-rise just steps from the subway. The condo\\xe2\\x80\\x99s owner had been buffeted by the recession, and even before he moved in,  decided to sublet the apartment and live somewhere cheaper elsewhere on the island.\\nThe Fortunas, who arrived last February and pay $3,100 a month, are the apartment\\xe2\\x80\\x99s first residents. Everything was so new, they could  smell the varnish on the hardwood floors. The chalk-white walls were so pristine, the couple were at first reluctant to hang pictures.\\nAlthough modest in size, the apartment radiates traces of the glamour associated with those pieds-\\xc3\\xa0-terre familiar from 1940s movies set in the more luxurious precincts of Manhattan \\xe2\\x80\\x94 \\xe2\\x80\\x9call windows and filled with light,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as a friend described the place.\\nIn the living room, floor-to-ceiling windows open onto views of the East River, the 59th Street Bridge, the Manhattan skyline and the seemingly endless expanse of Queens. Barges drifting along the river offer an endlessly shifting vista. Even the hulking power plant over in Astoria appears  picturesque. Looking down, the couple can see the grassy field where Mr. Fortuna plays soccer and softball on weekends.\\nThe views are nearly as dazzling in the bedroom, where the bridge seems so close, you feel as if you could reach out and touch one of its girders. Especially for a woman whose workdays focus on the rehabilitation of one of the city\\xe2\\x80\\x99s famous bridges, these vistas seem singularly appropriate.\\nThe furnishings, among them the spare black dining table, the gray and white sofa in the living room and the multicolored pillows heaped on the sofa bed in the second bedroom, came largely by way of Ikea. The store was also the source of an urban scene almost as compelling as the one out their windows  \\xe2\\x80\\x94  a copy of Angelo Cavalli\\xe2\\x80\\x99s famous black-and-white photograph of the Flatiron Building framed by a dense swath of the city.\\nThe Fortunas themselves are avid photographers, and their walls are filled with images of the two of them, eyes shining and glossy dark hair gleaming, against one or another exotic backdrop. Here is Ms. Fortuna on the beach in Rio. Here are the two of them kissing near the Eiffel Tower. Here they are kissing again in the Turks and Caicos Islands.\\nThe contents of their bookshelves seem an amalgam of their varied interests, home to her engineering texts (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAtmospheric Chemistry and Physics\\xe2\\x80\\x9d), his computer books (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWeb Data Mining\\xe2\\x80\\x9d), a few titles in Portuguese and textbooks that have over the years helped the couple perfect their English (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Ins and Outs of Prepositions\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).\\nUnless you peered behind closed doors to see the two walk-in closets or the washer/dryer, you might miss what for Ms. Fortuna are among the apartment\\xe2\\x80\\x99s main attractions. But you would never miss the couple\\xe2\\x80\\x99s two beloved cats, strays born on the island and rescued by a group called Island Cats.\\nThe Fortunas found Daisy, now 3, who is gray with white feet, through an ad in The Main Street Wire, the island newspaper, where \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthere was a big picture of her,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Ms. Fortuna recalled. Fletcher, now a lively brown 1-year-old, joined the household as a foster cat and proved so adorable the couple couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t bear to give him to another family.\\nJust as the waterfront promenade helped the Fortunas sink roots in this community, so did the rescue group. When the couple first arrived, Ms. Fortuna used to look out the window of their apartment and see the clusters of people who helped feed and otherwise care for the island\\xe2\\x80\\x99s strays. She and her husband signed up as volunteers and in doing so acquired an instant set of new and compatible friends.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cReally,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Fortuna said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthese friends are one of the reasons we stay on the island.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nMore recently, the couple celebrated another landmark that has helped them feel deeply connected to the community.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTwo months ago they put our building on Google Earth,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Fortuna, the computer whiz, said proudly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat made us feel wonderful.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n', 'When world record holder Haile Gebrselassie dropped out of the New York City Marathon just more than halfway through, it opened the door for a different man from Ethiopia to grab the stage and Gebre Gebremariam took advantage.\\nGebremariam, 26, made his splash in his marathon debut, using a devastating finishing kick he developed at shorter distances to finish first in 2 hours 8 minutes 14 seconds. He had come into the final miles in Central Park neck-and-neck with Emmanuel Mutai of Kenya but put the race away in strong fashion. (Read Liz Robbins\\xe2\\x80\\x99s article on Gebremariam\\xe2\\x80\\x99s victory here.)\\nEdna Kiplagat of Kenya made a similarly devastating move in Central Park to grab the women\\xe2\\x80\\x99s title in 2:28:20.

He was 20 seconds behind as the top two are neck-and-neck in the final hills at Mile 24. This will be a great finish.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x94 Lynn Zinser\\nEdna Kiplagat of Kenya used a strong push through the hills of Central Park to leave her nearest competitors behind far behind as the finish line neared.\\nShe won in 2:28.20. \\nKiplagat, 31, has had a phenomenal year. She won her first three races of 2010, including the Los Angeles Marathon, all in personal best times. The other was a 15K in Utica, N.Y. and the Steamboat (Ill.) Classic 4-Mile.\\nFlanagan caught Keitani in the hills of the final mile and finished second in 2:28.40.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x94 Lynn Zinser\\nIt appeared Gebremariam and Mutai had turned the men\\xe2\\x80\\x99s race to a two-man contest, but Kwambai has not given up. He is only a few meters back. From appearances, though, Gebremariam looks to be running the easiest at Mile 23. He is the 2009 world cross-country champion and he is known for his finishing speed.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x94 Lynn Zinser\\nGebre Gebremariam, of Ethiopia, leading the race with Mutai, is only one half of the debut duo from Ethiopia. His wife, Werknesh Kidane was supposed to make her marathon debut, but pulled out with a calf injury this week. She stayed home in Ethiopia with their two sons.\\n\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x9cShe told me to win for her,\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x9d Gebremariam said.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x94 Liz Robbins\\nEdna Kiplagat is looking like the experienced marathoner she is, using her strength to pull ahead of Keitany and Flanagan, who has dropped to a distant third. She is only lengthening her lead as the finish line nears.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x94 Lynn Zinser\\nIn Central Park, Edna Kiplagat began pushing the pace and Keitany went with her, but Flanagan fell off their pace and is now desperately trying to catch up again.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x94 Lynn Zinser\\nThe men\\xe2\\x80\\x99s race continued to string out, with Gebre Gebremariam of Ethiopia battling out front with Emmanuel Mutai of Kenya. It pits two of the world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s best marathoning countries. Not unexpected on that front, but most thought Gebrselassie would be the Ethiopian contending for the title.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x94 Lynn Zinser\\nMary Keitany of Kenya is the world champion at the half-marathon and Shalane Flanagan of the United States is the reigning bronze medalist in the Olympic 10,000 meters but that hardly means they would win their first marathon \\xe2\\x80\\x94 but both have an excellent chance.\\nAbout to enter Central Park past the 21-mile mark, Keitany and Flanagan were in the lead pack of three with Edna Kiplagat of Kenya, the one of the three with marathon experience. She won the Los Angeles Marathon earlier this year.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x94 Lynn Zinser\\nIt has been since 2007 that a man from Kenya has won the New York City Marathon. But this has been quite a fall for the running-rich nation.\\nHow about this astounding statistic of dominance? Race Results Weekly helped tracked 45 fall marathons with international fields since Sept. 5. and found that men from Kenya have won 40 of them, and Ethiopian men have won the other five.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x94 Liz Robbins\\nI walked out my building in Fort Greene this morning and saw small knots of people running down the sidewalk. Some were pushing strollers, some were dragging small dogs in their wake.\\nThere was no real rush \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the New York City marathon was already well underway and it would be hours before the final stragglers made their way down Lafayette Avenue and the neighborhood would return to normal. But watching my neighbors rush down the street, I couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t help but feel that I needed to run, too.  There was the unmistakable feeling that we were missing something.\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been said before, but Marathon Sunday is the day New Yorkers put away their stranger faces, the ones that allow them to function every day in packed subways and elevators and movie theaters. They make signs for people they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve never met, plan elaborate playlists to blare out their windows, and drop any aloof pretense.\\nOnce I arrived at Lafayette, I noticed that a band had set up outside the deli where I usually pick up milk. A few blocks down, someone had set up loudspeakers and was blaring everything from Born to Run to Footloose. People were cheering, but they were also all-out dancing \\xe2\\x80\\x94 shaking their hips and shouting out the lyrics to Billy Idol\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMony Mony.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nOnce the elite athletes passed through \\xe2\\x80\\x94 they flashed by in a blur of police motorcycles and press trucks \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the runners joined the party. One was dressed in a Minnie Mouse outfit. Another wore a full-length, hot-pink bodysuit. One ran by sipping a can of beer.\\nAcross the street, I noticed a woman and her son passing out cookies from an aluminum tin. The spectators smiled, as touched as I was by this small-town display of neighborliness. But not a single person took a cookie.\\nThis is New York, after all.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x93Katie Thomas\\nFirst Avenue is the great separator, the downhill of Manhattan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Upper East Side, and the crowd\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wild cheering, combining to spur the runners to go even faster than some might be able to handle.\\nJames Kwambai, of Kenya, sprinted just steps ahead of Mutai, of Kenya, Bouramdane, of Morocco, and Gebre Gebramariam, of Ethiopia. They ran a 4:26 17th mile.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x94 Liz Robbins\\nAt Mile 21, the women\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pack is down to eight, with Shalane Flanagan still in there sharing the front of that pack with Mary Keitany of Kenya \\nBy Saturday night, the buzz began among the men\\xe2\\x80\\x99s professional field that Gebrselassie\\xe2\\x80\\x99s knee was not in good shape. He was getting it worked on, two coaches noted, but whether that was strategy or reality was yet unclear. Gebrselassie made it clear on his Twitter feed right before the race, and despite his staying in the lead pack for the first 15 miles, the pain, apparently was too intense before he even made it to Manhattan.\\nNew York Road Runners officials said Gebrselassie underwent an MRI on Saturday night and there was fluid found on his knee.\\nThis is the second straight race in New York that Gebrselassie withdrew mid-race. At the half-marathon in March, he pulled up with asthma problems.\\nEven before he started on Sunday, Gebrselassie had committed to running the Tokyo Marathon in February. \\n\\xe2\\x80\\x93Liz Robbins\\nThe lead pack not only lost Haile Gebrselassie, who dropped out before the 17-mile mark, but defending champion Meb Keflezighi fell off the pace as the lead pack began to string out along First Avenue in Manhattan. \\nThere are four men at the very front: Mutai, Gebre, Kwambai and Bouramdane. \\nJust a women\\xe2\\x80\\x99s note: earlier this week, Shalane Flanagan said she thought that a 2:25 would win the race and she had been training around that pace. But she was cautious about her own chances, saying she just wanted to make the podium in her marathon debut. In Mile 19, Flanagan took the lead and the pace is in her favor, heading towards a 2:30 finish.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x94 Liz Robbins\\nWomen\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x99s wheelchair winner Tatyana McFadden gained national attention when she led a move to pass the Fitness and Athletics Equity for Students with Disabilities Act, which the Maryland state legislature passed in 2008. Before the law was passed, McFadden was forced to compete by herself at Atholton High School (Maryland) track and field meets. The law ensures that students with disabilities have equal opportunities to participate in physical education and athletic programs, and allowed her to compete in the same events on the track at the same time along with able-bodied athletes.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x93Dave Ungrady\\nGebrselassie just stopped running, as he was charging downward on the Queensboro Bridge. He was favoring his knee, started slowing and then pulled up in the 16th mile. This is a stunning development, albeit one he, himself, might have predicted. \\n\\xe2\\x80\\x93Liz Robbins\\nOn the Queensboro Bridge, world record holder Haile Gebrselassie pulled up and stopped.\\nIf Shalane Flanagan is feeling uncomfortable in her first marathon or feeling any pressure as the lead American star here, she is not showing it. Near the 30 K mark, Flanagan is running with an easy stride and showing no signs of extraordinary effort or discomfort. \\nShe took the lead at the front of the lead pack, with others expending much more obvious effort, including Kim Smith of New Zealand, who was up front with Flanagan.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x93Lynn Zinser\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cnyseiler\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is in Long Island City and on Twitter, waiting for the elite men.  She\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not the only one, as you can see here spectators starting to crowd the sidewalks this morning and stretching their necks for a view.\\nMeb Keflezighi lead the pack at the half-marathon mark of 65:19, quite a grinding pace that, if it holds, could be one of the slowest finishes since Martin Lel ran a 2:10.30 to win in 2003.\\nAs the defending champion, Keflezighi has had a whirlwind last few days in New York, making appearances, giving news conferences, going to parties since Tuesday of this week \\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x93 much to his coach\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x99s chagrin. Bob Larsen, who has coached Keflezighi for 17 years after guiding him at U.C.L.A., said Keflezighi finally got off his feet on Friday and started to relax.\\nBut Larsen also noted that Keflezighi, 35, a father of three, is good at multi-tasking. And after last year\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x99s victory in New York, a veritable lifetime achievement award, he deserves to soak up all of the accolades this week.\\nKeflezighi said that 12 of his family members are in town, including his parents and one of his brothers who took the red-eye flight from California just in time for the race.\\nWhile he admitted that another victory in New York (which would make him the first American man to repeat as champion since Alberto Salazar did it in 1982), would be \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe frosting on the cake,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he does not appear to be content with last year\\xe2\\x80\\x99s laurel crown. He continues to stay ahead in the lead pack. This type of race favors his methodical style.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x94 Liz Robbins\\nChilean miner Edison Pena not only got a late invitation to the New York City Marathon but he also got a team. The New York Road Runners gave him two escorts, Spanish-speaking members who are running with him: Juan Jesus Lopez of the Bronx and Rene Cuahuizo of Elmhurst. They are making sure other runners don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t crowd Pena too much trying to get into the television picture.

At Mile 7, the men ran their fastest mile so far \\xe2\\x80\\x934:47.

Marilson Gomes dos Santos, the two-time  champion, tried a brief spurt, too. They lifted the pack to a 4:52 sixth  mile pace. Amid the surging, Gebrselassie stayed comfortably in the  middle of the lead pack. \\n\\xe2\\x80\\x93Liz Robbins\\nIf all goes as planned, Ron Hankins, 52, of Des Moines will see a familiar sight through each of the boroughs as he runs his ninth marathon: bright yellow ears of corn.\\nFifteen of his friends are in New York from Iowa to surprise him with foam helmets in the shape of corn that each will to wear on various points along the route.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe wore pink wigs in Boston, and he said it really gave him a boost,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Jackie Quinn, who was with the group on 92nd Street in Bay Ridge.

He has finished second in 2005 here, and third in 2007. At 38, Ramaala now has a second job beyond his marathon  training (which he does on a 3.5 kilometer loop in a public park in  Johannesburg).\\nRamaala is the new assistant administrator of Athletics South Africa, and his law degree from  Johannesburg\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x99s University  of Witwatersrand is now coming in handy.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x94 Liz Robbins\\nThe women\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lead pack is comprised of 12 women, with no one willing to make any move through 15 K. The pace is very slow, with no one like Paula Radcliffe (who is taking a maternity leave from the sport she has ruled) to force the issue. Defending champion Derartu Tulu is in the back of that pack, playing it cautiously along with everyone else.\\nAlso in that pack is American Shalane Flanagan, looking comfortable with the non-aggressive pace.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x93Lynn Zinser\\nGebrselassie  came off the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge tucked into the lead pack, having run a very slow opening mile \\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x93 5  minutes, 55 seconds. He said before the race that he was going to sit back and  watch. One runner, however, wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t adhering to such a strategy.  Abderrahime Bouramdane, the veteran from Morrocco, broke away from the  pack in Bay Ridge, at Mile 3, a rather unusual move this early in the  race. \\n\\xe2\\x80\\x94 Liz Robbins\\nThe women\\xe2\\x80\\x99s leaders are still firmly in a pack in Mile 7, with no notable moves so far and you would think the men, in Mile 2, haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even had a chance to consider moves yet because their first mile over the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge was very slow, indicative of a stiff headwind. And with temperatures just creeping over 40, it was a chilly one.\\nBut, there is a small move in the men\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pack, with Abderrahime Bouramdane of Morocco making a little surge. It doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t look like it will turn into anything major, however.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x93Lynn Zinser\\nForget Haile Gebrselassie\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 the star of this race is Chilean miner Edison Pena, whom race director Mary Wittenberg gave a special introduction for at the beginning of the race. Before he lined up, he gave a short television interview via translator when he was asked about the weather, but the first part, everybody understood:\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMucho frio, mucho frio,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said.\\nHe said his reception in New York has been overwhelming: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPeople here have been so nice to me and given me a warm welcome. People stop me on the street to say hello. Everybody has been fabulous.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nHe also said he was running not only for himself, but to inspire others to run a marathon: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI would like to inspire young children to run because running makes you free.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x93Lynn Zinser\\nAs the women\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x99s race is now underway, a reminder that the New York City Marathon serves as the 2010 USA Women\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x99s Marathon championships.\\nShalane Flanagan, the 2008 Olympic bronze medalist in the 10,000 meters who is making her marathon debut, is the marquee favorite, but her inexperience at the distance creates questions about how she will respond to the challenge. Katie MGregor, the 2005 U.S. outdoor 10,000 champion, has run two marathons, both here in New York, with a personal best 2:31:14 in 2008. She\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x99s finished in the top 10 in New York in both races.\\nLinda Somers Smith, 49, is a sentimental favorite. She ran her personal best 2:30:06 in 1996 and was seventh in the 1995 marathon world championships. Smith ran 2:36:33 and finished sixth at the Los Angeles Marathon earlier this year.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x93Dave Ungrady\\nHaile Gebrselassie, the world-record holder, he announced before the race.

At one end are the fun and highly focused sites like Street Mattress (founded in 2001 and still posting pictures of discarded Posturepedics). At the other are more academically minded ruminations on refuse, like Discard Studies, started in August. Last Night\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Garbage occupies a space between these two poles. Photographs of trash dominate the blog and provide its author, Jed Tamarkin, with inspiration for writing short bits of fiction.\\nThe blog, which gets about 25,000 page views a month, has evolved since Mr. Tamarkin began shooting pictures outside his East Village apartment in the summer of 2007. Each photo was accompanied by text describing a fictional character with some relationship to whatever toy or commode or stroller happened to be lying on the street as Mr. Tamarkin passed by with his Canon point-and-shoot. (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a lot of baby strollers for some reason,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said.) Tags along the right side of the blog chronicle some of the recurring characters. There is Ross, a hard-drinking artist with relationship troubles; Stef, a chatty and celebrity-obsessed young woman; and Bobby, a drug-addled musician. There are also people who appeared only once, tossed off like so many old items of clothing. \\nMore recently, Mr. Tamarkin began pairing photographs with reposted bits of content to create \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca nudge and a rib\\xe2\\x80\\x9d about the wastefulness of consumer culture. In a post from July, an excerpt from a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCBS News\\xe2\\x80\\x9d article about a man who was fined for taking garbage off the street runs underneath a photograph of a destroyed air-conditioner. The juxtaposition is funny and seems to carry a subtle message: Not all trash is someone else\\xe2\\x80\\x99s treasure; most of it just ends up in the landfill.\\nBEHIND THE SCREEN \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI was on the first floor, and there was garbage accumulating everywhere,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Tamarkin, 31, an advertising art director, said of the apartment that provided early grist for the blog. His window faced a shaft at the rear of the building, where years of refuse had caked into the concrete. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI had crazy rat problems,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. (He now lives in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.)\\nHe started taking photographs simply to document the situation for the building\\xe2\\x80\\x99s management company, but pretty soon, he said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cit got me seeing trash in a new way, actually looking at it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The lines, forms and colors of an ordinary pile of garbage started to resemble sculpture, and the blog began as a kind of ode to what he came to see as the city\\xe2\\x80\\x99s accidental artists. Mr. Tamarkin attaches more than the usual sentimental value to things, which may account for his interest in recreating back stories for other people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s castoffs. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy wife, I think, would call me a pack rat,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said.\\nThough much of Last Night\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Garbage is from the East Village, Mr. Tamarkin carries his camera around with him, and lately has been posting about once a week. The neighborhoods where pictures are taken are not specified on the site, and appear to be beside the point. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis blog is based out of New York City,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut it could be anywhere.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nNew York Online periodically profiles blogs and Web sites made in New York City.

It crashed into the middle of Havemeyer Street, crushing a parked car, setting off alarms and blocking the street. A deafening chorus of horns rose outside Atlas\\xe2\\x80\\x99s window as traffic halted. An 18-wheeler executed a sketchy 10-point turn in the middle of a crowded intersection before a pair of fire trucks made their way through the traffic jam in a blaze of red. Chain saws roared, sawdust flew and the horns built to a  peak. It was New York urban pandemonium at its finest.\\nInside the warm confines of Atlas, separated from the chaos by only a thin wall of glass, not a soul stirred. A quiet mention was made of the falling tree, a few heads rose for a second, and then, just as quickly, they ducked back down. They all returned to whatever was on the other side of their glowing, partly eaten apples. On a day when the cafe Internet connection had already been down for four hours, and the toilet had been blocked for even longer, I thought I had seen these worker bees pushed to their limit. But I had underestimated them. Nothing could stir these people. They were not in New York; they were citizens of Laptopistan.\\nI was an interloper among them, an anthropologist of sorts, sent to untangle their odd society, to understand their mores and unwritten rules. How did the natives interact? How did the government function? What was the economy like in this land of bottomless cups and table hoggers? And what, oh what, were they all writing?\\nI was, admittedly, a profoundly skeptical observer. Though I had been a freelance writer for the last eight years, I had always worked at home, clad in pajamas and brewing my own fuel rather than paying $3 for someone to make pretty designs in my caffeinated foam. Whenever my wife suggested that I get out of the house, maybe take my laptop to a cafe, I shot back: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cReal freelancers don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t work in coffee shops. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just unemployed hipsters and their unpublished novels, or screenplays, or Facebook stati.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nMy disdain for the coffee shop writing scene only grew this June, when I met a friend at the Red Horse Cafe in Park Slope. I had previously been there only on weekends, when it was filled with couples sharing the Sunday paper and parents wiping brownie residue off their toddlers. That weekday afternoon it was a place transformed. Gone were the newspapers and the strollers. Laptops had colonized every flat surface. No one uttered a word; people just stared into screens, expressionless. It felt like that moment in a horror movie when the innocent couple stumbles into a house filled with hibernating zombies, and they listen, in terror, as the floorboard creaks.\\nMy friend and I ordered our coffee, and began to discuss whatever it was we were there to discuss. Within seconds of opening my mouth, I felt a change in the room. Eyes rose from their screens and landed on us \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the zombies were awake, and they weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t happy. One of them passed our table on the way to the washroom and let loose what can only be described as a snicker. We downed our coffee and beat a quick retreat. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTo hell with those laptop-wielding fundamentalists,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I said.\\nSo what was I doing in Laptopistan? I moved from New York to Toronto in September, but had come back to the city for a week and was sleeping on a friend\\xe2\\x80\\x99s couch. I needed a place to work. Someone suggested Atlas. I swallowed my skepticism and got my passport ready.\\nSET on the corner of Havemeyer and Grand Streets, and flooded with light from two walls of windows, Atlas Caf\\xc3\\xa9, which opened in 2003, looks like a combination of worn trattoria and late 1990s Seattle coffeehouse. The name reflects its wall-sized map of the world (there are also a mobile of hanging globes, and flourishes of d\\xc3\\xa9cor inspired by someone\\xe2\\x80\\x99s travel to the Far East). The soundtrack is a mix of old country and folk (Dylan, Willy, Cohen and Cash), classical, bebop and French ballads.\\nA makeshift milk station sits in the center of the 750-square-foot room. To the left is a long bar of dark stained rustic wood, where people order food and drink (proper espressos for $1.50, excellent panini, salads and deadly little chocolate-filled Italian doughnuts,  $3), as well as the windowless, orange washroom. There are three stools at the bar, and beside them a table of reclaimed timber pressed against a cozy window bench. According to two signs, this little corner, perhaps one-sixth of the cafe, is designated a laptop-free zone.\\nEverything beyond is Laptopistan: two rows of old church pews formed into an elongated L, each fronted by small wooden tables and chairs. Scattered along the pews are tattered blue tubular pillows, for lumbar support. Windows run along the walls, flooding the computer zone with natural light during the day, creating a fishbowl effect for those inside looking out, and for passers-by, who frequently stop and stare at the tableau.\\nEntering Laptopistan is a task in itself. The floor presents an obstacle course of power cables snaking their way around coffee cups, over chairs, and around table legs, eventually finding a home in one of two power strips that look as though they came from a Soviet coal refinery. Whenever a plug is inserted, the outlet sparks, and certain movements can cause all the plugs on a given strip to simultaneously eject.\\nA quick glance around shows I have brought my laptop, a month-old MacBook Pro, to its nesting ground. Diversity here means the odd white MacBook or old black PowerBook scattered amid the silver MacBook Pros. Throughout the week I will see only a handful of PCs, each looking sadly out of place, like they have arrived at a black-tie affair in a corduroy blazer.\\nI worked for a few hours, and quickly learned the principal laws of Laptopistan:\\nSilence Is Golden. There is no prohibition on talking, of course, but, as one Atlas regular of several years, Joelle Hann, explained, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s almost a code that people aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t going to talk loud.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d When people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s phones ring, they run outside as fast as possible to take the call.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf someone\\xe2\\x80\\x99s on Skype or having a conversation, people make an effort to chill out their conversations with looks,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Ms. Hann, a yoga teacher and a freelance journalist and textbook editor. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhen they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t stop, you can feel the tension.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Shushing conversations is equally verboten. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo one wants to be the librarian,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Ms. Hann added.\\nRespect Personal Space. While any open seat is technically available, it is forbidden to set up your computer on a table with a computer already on it; doubling up is allowed only when all tables are taken. At the same time, people bounce from table to table throughout the day, chasing the sun, the shade or their own feng shui.\\nMind Your Neighborhood. When you get up to take a call, get coffee or use the washroom, you need only to look at a neighbor, make eye contact, look back at your computer and nod. The deal is sealed without a word: You watch my MacBook and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll watch yours.\\nMOST Laptopistanis \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Laptopistanites? Laptopistanians? \\xe2\\x80\\x94 at Atlas are in their 20s, 30s or early 40s, split evenly between men and women. The dress is casual, with both sexes wearing T-shirts, sweaters and jeans, though a few women seem dressed for \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwork\\xe2\\x80\\x9d with button-down blouses, blazers, even a dress or two. Most Laptopistanis work alone, though occasionally I spotted a group collaborating at a corner table. Socially, Laptopistan is a conservative society; outward displays of emotion are frowned upon. Most people hide behind their screens.\\nAaron Tugendhaft is the exception. He appears at Atlas every morning for a few hours, tie askew, black coffee at his side, some heady-looking book in front of him. Mr. Tugendhaft, who is an adjunct professor of religion at New York University and the editor of a small custom press, is one of the only Atlas regulars I observed sans laptop.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve made friends with people because I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m the only guy without a computer,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he told me, quietly, one morning. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA book can be a conversation starter.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nMr. Tugendhaft has been coming to Atlas nearly every day for three and a half years, but there are many Laptopistanis he has never spoken to. (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSome of them are in the room right now,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he confided in a low voice, eyeing a woman in a jean jacket two tables over.) He has dated fellow Laptopistanis, but not anymore, preferring to keep romance out of the workplace. People tend to keep to themselves, he said, until something breaks the routine: an argument between lovers, news of a subway breakdown, or, most often, some sort of interaction around the power strips.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPower is power,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Tugendhaft said.\\nMallory Roberts, a longhaired freelance astrophysicist, said that he had met two girlfriends (now exes), and his current roommate, via power-strip negotiations. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThree months ago Courtney was looking for a plug and we got to talking,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said of the roommate, with whom he is now working on a documentary about a giant telescope in Puerto Rico. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt turns out we went to the same university, and she needed a place to stay.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a recognition here,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he added, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat people come to a cafe to not be alone.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nTHE cost of living in Laptopistan, at least for my personal intake of tea, bagels, sandwiches and salad, averaged $12 a day. Other cafes popular with freelancers charge for wireless Internet access and even table time, but the owners of the Atlas, Enrico Lorenzetti and Luca Tesconi, refuse to. Observing the gross daily consumption in Laptopistan, where people seem to nurse a cup of coffee and a cookie  for hours, I could not imagine how the two managed to stay in business. But they said the laptops were a stealth economic engine.\\nWhile the people behind the screens spent a paltry $6 to $10 per day, their true value is as a draw for more profitable takeout customers, Mr. Lorenzetti said. From the moment the door opens at 7 a.m. until it closes at 9 p.m., the place is buzzing, a productive society, visible from the street through wraparound windows. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPeople come in to buy food and coffee to go, because they see a full crowd,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey think \\xe2\\x80\\x98Hey, this place must be good if I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even get a table.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xc2\\xa0\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nMy long-held notion that Laptopistan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s citizens were just sitting around e-mailing other writers in other cafes around the world dissipated as I got to know the MacBook Pro owners around me. Sure, there were aspiring screenwriters, novelists and people updating Twitter, but there was also Gauri Nanda, a product designer from Detroit who created Clocky, the alarm clock on wheels that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s featured at the MoMA store and sold worldwide. There was Billy Schultz, a corporate human resources consultant crunching numbers for spreadsheets in PowerPoint and Excel (on a Lenovo PC, no less), and Meredith Sadin, working on her doctorate in American politics at Princeton.\\nLaptopistan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s is an entrepreneurial economy, driven by solitary thinkers. Aszure Barton, a choreographer from Alberta, was working with colleagues to prepare for her contemporary dance show called BUSK, which will debut Dec. 17 at the Jerome Robbins Theater. Robert Olinger runs a biotech startup that is getting silkworms to make spider silk at commercial scale, designs online education programs for the New York City Department of Education, and directs theater projects with Russian artists. In just a few days I met architects and event planners, database designers, classical musicians, film editors and app developers, every facet of the creative economy working under one roof, not so much together as in tandem.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHere, people have large ambitions,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Olinger said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSome have resources, some don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. They don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have career plans mapped out, but they have a career in mind. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not looking at a particular ladder to climb, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re looking at a mountain to conquer.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nWHEN that tree fell that Wednesday afternoon, I was one of the only people who walked over to check it out. I knew I was becoming one of them when a voice in my head said: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cO.K., time to get back to work.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nAt home, the slightest change in light is enough of an excuse to get up, walk around, clip my nails or head into the kitchen. Though home offices seem like the perfect work environment, their unrestricted silence, uninterrupted solitude and creature comforts breed distraction. In Laptopistan, I focused with intense precision, sitting motionless for hours at a time. At home, when the Internet goes down, I feel professionally castrated, and usually retire to the sofa until the connection is restored. When the wireless network at Atlas seized up two afternoons in a row, I just switched to off-line tasks without breaking stride. No one else seemed fazed, either. If anything, the place got more crowded. Laptopistan provides structure, and freelancers, like children, secretly crave structure. You come to work, for two or four or eight hours, and you take comfort in the knowledge that everyone else is there to work as well. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a silent social pressure to it all.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt almost sounds sick,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Selena Ross, a fellow Canadian freelance journalist I sat next to one day, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut the fact that people are watching me do my work helps me be what they expect me to be. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s like working exhibitionism.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nBack home in Toronto, with my ergonomically correct chair, spacious desk and dedicated Internet connection, I pulled up my notes from the journey to Laptopistan and tried to write. Within 10 minutes, I was lost in Facebook and watching old \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSoul Train\\xe2\\x80\\x9d clips on YouTube.\\nSo I unplugged my laptop, traded my sweat pants for jeans and walked two blocks to the nearest coffee shop. There was some country music playing at a comfortable volume, and the familiar sight of cords along the floor. I took a seat between a guy working on an identical MacBook Pro and a woman drawing in a journal, and I worked like I was back in Atlas: productively, contentedly, fueled by a steady diet of Earl Grey tea, an economically acceptable quantity of cookies, and that social pressure I was craving.\\nAfter an hour or so, the guy next to me got up to go to the washroom, turned toward his laptop and looked at me.\\nWith a nod, I completed the transaction. When he walked away, I smiled. It was not a big smile; most likely it was barely visible to anyone looking beyond my screen. Precisely the secret smile that citizens of Laptopistan allow themselves when no one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s looking.\\n']\n"
